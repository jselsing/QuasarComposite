###QuasarComposite
===============
A repository to contain the the X-shooter Quasar Composite.
All code used to generate the figures and data handling are in the py-directory. The data used here is public and available under ESO program ID 090.A-0147(A). The reduction setup used is the ReflexWorkflow.kar, which uses the ESO X-shooter pipeline version 2.5.2. The code is a mess, develped while learning to code.

The composite itself is the file Selsing2015.dat. Feel free to download and use, but please give credit. The publication is currently submitted to A&A. This site will be updated when the paper is out, with the reference.
