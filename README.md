###QuasarComposite
===============
A repository to contain the the X-shooter Quasar Composite.
All code used to generate the figures and data handling are in the py-directory. 

The composite itself is the file Selsing2015.dat. Feel free to download and use. 

The publication is currently submitted to A&A. This site will be updated when the paper is out, with the reference.
