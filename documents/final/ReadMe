Abstract:
	Quasi-stellar object (QSO) spectral templates are important both to
	QSO physics and for investigations that use QSOs as probes of
	intervening gas and dust. However, combinations of various QSO
	samples obtained at different times and with different instruments
	so as to expand a composite and to cover a wider rest frame
	wavelength region may create systematic effects, and the
	contribution from QSO hosts may contaminate the composite. We have
	constructed a composite spectrum from luminous blue QSOs at 1 < z <
	2.1 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The
	observations with X-shooter simultaneously cover ultraviolet (UV) to
	near-infrared (NIR) light, which ensures that the composite
	spectrum covers the full rest-frame range from Ly\beta to 11350 \AA
	without any significant host contamination. Assuming a power-law
	continuum for the composite we find a spectral slope of \alpha_\lambda =
	1.70 +/- 0.01, which is steeper than previously found in the literature.
	We attribute the differences to our broader spectral wavelength
	coverage, which allows us to effectively avoid fitting any regions
	that are affected either by strong QSO emissions lines (e.g., Balmer
	lines and complex [Fe II] blends) or by intrinsic host galaxy
	emission. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the QSO
	composite spectrum for evaluating the reddening in other QSOs.

Description:
	Quasar composite made from bright QSOs, as described in the paper.
	The composite consists of wavelength with corresponding arbitrarily
	normalized flux and error.
	The source code and composite is also made available at
