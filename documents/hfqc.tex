QSO templates are important both for QSO physics and for projects using QSOs as probes. However, the current most widely used QSO template, namely the SDSS composite QSO spectrum of Vanden Berk et al. (2001) suffers from significant host galaxy contamination redwards of 5000\AA in the restframe. At these wavelenghts the SDSS template is based on intrinsically faint, low-redshift QSOs. We here propose to build a composite QSO spectrum for bright blue QSOs without this problem using X-shooter GTO time. With X-shooter we can target bright SDSS QSOs in the redshift range $1 < z < 2.3$ and hence build a composite spectrum covering the full range from Ly$\alpha$ to 8500\AA in the restframe without significant host galaxy contamination.

\section{Introduction}     \sectlabel{introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%The optical-to-ultraviolet emission mechanism of quasars are by now quite well understood \citep{Elvis1994}. A supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy is surrounded by a hot accretion disc which emits a featureless thermal continuum. The central continuum photoionizes a region of hot clouds, and further out, cold clouds which gives rise to lines with both broad and narrow components \citep{Elvis2001}.  Varying conditions in the clouds ensure that each ionic species have optimal conditions to produce line emission \citep{Baldwin1995}. Despite the apparent different conditions in which the emission arises, the overall shape of most quasar spectra look similar {\color{red} Reference needed}. The remarkable uniformity of the average spectral properties across luminosity and redshift indicate very similar underlying physical mechanisms which can be understood in terms of Eigenvector 1 (\citep{Boroson1992}; \cite{Francis1992}) where the Eddington ratio drives the relative strength of the lines and orientation effects influences the observed kinematics of the lines \citep{Shen2014a} accounting for the majority of the inter-quasar variation. This means that the accretion rate and the mass of the black hole largely determines the spectral appearance of a given quasar. 
%
%Template spectra are useful for a wide range of purposes, e.g., the detection of features that are too weak to be detected in individual spectra, identification of objects that differ from the mean, etc. Examples of such composite spectra include template spectra of various classes of galaxies (\cite{Shapley2003}; \cite{Dobos2012}), QSOs (\cite{CristianiS.andVio1990}; \cite{Boyle1990}; \cite{Francis1991}; \cite{Zheng1997} \cite{Brotherton2000}; \cite{VandenBerk2001}; \cite{Telfer2002}; \cite{Richards2006}; \cite{Glikman2006}) and GRB afterglows \citep{Christensen2011}. In particular, QSO composite spectra have been studied and discussed intensively since the first papers in the early 1990ies.
%
%When investigating dust in quasars, templates can be used to determine the amount of extinction by artificially reddening to match an observed spectrum (\cite{Glikman2007}; \cite{Urrutia2009}; \cite{Wang2012}; \cite{Fynbo2013}; \cite{Krogager2015}). The amount of extinction inferred will depend on what kind of dust is assumed,  which for quasars has been found to be SMC-like (\cite{Richards2003}; \cite{Hopkins2004}),  the parametrization chosen (\cite{Gordon2003};\cite{Fitzpatrick2005} ) and the template spectrum used. 
%
%The wavelength coverage of a single instrument is always limited and therefore templates from different telescopes cover different regions. The redshift distribution of quasars are exploited to extend the wavelength coverage of a single instrument while covering bad atmospheric windows, but because of the this, different parts of the template will be attributed to different redshifts. Several instruments can be combined to extend the wavelength coverage of a single template as is done in \citep{Glikman2006} where SDSS \citep{Gunn2006} and IRTF, SpeX \citep{Rayner2003} spectra are combined to cover the range from 2700 \AA~ to 37000 \AA, or several templates can be combined to cover regions of interest as done in \citep{Zhou2010} where the template of \citep{VandenBerk2001} 800 - 9200 \AA~ is stitched together at 3000 \AA~ with the \citep{Glikman2006} template. 
%
%The wide wavelength coverage of the template by \citep{Glikman2006} is used in studies of quasar SEDs (\cite{Richards2006}; \cite{Shang2011}), extinction measures (\cite{Glikman2007}; \cite{Wang2012}; \cite{Fynbo2013}) and AGN contamination in photo-z determinations \citep{MacDonald2010}.

Template spectra build as composites of many carefully selected individual spectra
are useful for a wide range of purposes, e.g., the detection
of features that are too weak to be detected in individual spectra,
identification of objects that differ from the template, etc. Examples of such
composite spectra include template spectra of various classes of galaxies
(\cite{Shapley2003}; \cite{Dobos2012}), QSOs (\citep{CristianiS.andVio1990, Boyle1990, Francis1991, Zheng1997, Brotherton2000};
\citep{VandenBerk2001, Telfer2002, Richards2006a, Glikman2006}) and GRB afterglows \citep{Christensen2011}.
Here we are in particular interested in  
QSO composite spectra.

When investigating dust in QSOs, templates are used to determine the
amount of extinction by artificially reddening the template 
to match an observed spectrum 
\citep[e.g.,][]{Glikman2007,Urrutia2009,Wang2012,Fynbo2013,Krogager2015}. 
The amount of extinction inferred will of course depend on the
assumed extinction curve. Many studies find that SMC-like extinction provides
a good match \citep{Richards2003,Hopkins2004}. In some cases steeper extinction
curves are required \citep{Fynbo2013,Jiang2013,Leighly2014}.

The wavelength coverage of a single instrument is always limited and therefore
templates from different telescopes cover different regions. The redshift
distribution of QSOs are exploited to extend the wavelength coverage of a
single instrument while covering bad atmospheric windows, but because of the
this, different parts of the template will be attributed to different
redshifts. Several instruments can be combined to extend the wavelength
coverage of a single template as is done in \citep{Glikman2006} where SDSS
\citep{Gunn2006} and IRTF, SpeX \citep{Rayner2003} spectra of UV-excess selected
QSOs in the redshift range 0.118--0.418 are combined to
cover the range from 2700 \AA~ to 37000 \AA, or several templates can be
combined to cover regions of interest as done in \citep{Zhou2010} where the
template of \citep{VandenBerk2001} 800 - 9200 \AA~ is stitched together at 3000
\AA~ with the \citep{Glikman2006} template. 

The template by \cite{VandenBerk2001} is widely
used in studies involving QSOs, where it has seen great use as a
cross-correlation template to determine redshifts (\cite{Stoughton2002};
\cite{Rafiee2011}), as a model for the optical QSO SEDs (\cite{Croom2004};
\cite{Hopkins2006}; \cite{Hopkins2007}) and for studies of the host galaxies of
AGN (\cite{Kauffmann2003b}). When using the \citet{VandenBerk2001} template
it is important to know that it contains significant host galaxy contamination
\citep[e.g.,][their Fig.~5]{Fynbo2013}. The 
goal of this paper is to use the X-shooter spectrograph to build a new 
QSO template that covers the full range from Ly$\beta$ to H$\alpha$ based on bright
SDSS QSOs and observed with a single instrument over the full spectral range.

In
\sect{sample} we descrine the sample selection and provide the datails 
of the observations.
\sect{construct} describes the constrution of the composite spectrum
and \sect{results} presents the resulting composite. In \sect{discuss} we do a

\section{Problems with the current most used template}   \sectlabel{problem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\jstodo{This section is just taken from the proposal and should be adapted to the paper}


The currently most widely used QSO template is the SDSS template of \citep{VandenBerk2001}. As described very clearly in that paper the SDSS composite spectrum shows a significant change to a shallower spectral slope around 5000 \r{A}. This is mainly attributed to contaminating light from the underlying host galaxy. Other effects also contribute, e.g. emission from a hot dust component, but the dominating factor is likely the host contamination. Our main motivation for building a QSO template without this problem is the following: we have initiated a search for dust-reddened QSOs using near-IR (NIR) selection of QSOs \citep{Fynbo2013}. In stripe 82 we have studied about 50 such candidate QSOs using the NTT. Whereas we searched for QSOs reddened by foreground absorber galaxies most systems we observe turn out to be QSOs reddened by dust in their host galaxies. The optical spectra can be well matched by the SDSS template spectrum reddened by SMC-like extinction, but the NIR (restframe optical) photometry from UKIDSS cannot be fitted. The problem is illustrated in their Fig. 6 where they attempt to model the EFOSC2 spectrum of a dust-reddened QSO at z = 1.16 here observed in our survey. As seen, the SDSS spectrum and photometry can be well matched with the Vanden Berk template, but the photometry from UKIDSS is much too blue for even the unreddened template. This is not a unique case, but a problem that is seen for all the dust reddened QSOs found in our search.
In the SDSS composite, the QSOs contribution to the spectrum at $ > 5000$\AA have to be at fairly low redshifts ($z \lesssim  0.5$). These QSOs have absolute magnitudes that are $3-4$ magnitudes fainter than bright $z > 1.5$ QSOs (see Fig. 1 in  \cite{VandenBerk2001}). They are also likely to have the brightest restframe optical host galaxies and hence host contamination is not surprising. Hence, by selecting intrinsically much brighter QSOs at higher redshifts we should be able to avoid the problem with host contamination.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Sample description}   \sectlabel{sample}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


In order to build a QSO spectrum with no significant host galaxy contamination we select very bright ($r \lesssim 17$) SDSS QSOs at redshifts $1 < z < 2.1$ for which host galaxy contamination should be insignificant and where we can use the redshift distribution to cover the regions of strong telluric absorption. Previous QSO templates in the literature have been based on hundreds of spectra, but this is neither possible nor necessary for us. We are mainly interested in tracing the shape of the continuum with negligible host contamination and wide wavelength coverage and for that a smaller sample will suffice. We have consequently selected the 7 brightest SDSS QSOs at $1 < z < 2.1$ and at declinations $\lesssim +15^\circ$ that are observable in a single visitor run and that have SDSS spectra without signs of BAL activity or other strong associated absorption systems. With this sample, all restframe wavelengths from \lya to 8500\AA~ will be covered by at least 4 spectra where we have corrected spectra for telluric absorption, which will give us a handle on the variance also. For all of the spectra we cover the region of \oii and \oiii, which is useful for determination of precise systemic redshifts.

Spectroscopic observation of the targets have been carried out using X-shooter \citep{Vernet2011}, the single-object cross-dispersion echelle spectrograph installed in UT2 at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The observations were carried out March, 2013 and for each object they consists of 4 exposures in nodding mode in the sequence ABBA with a total integration time of 1800s per object, simultaneous in the UVB(3600 - 5500~\AA), VIS(5500 - 10150~\AA)  and NIR(10150 - 24800~\AA) arms. The nominal resolving power $R = \lambda / \Delta \lambda$ for our observations is 4350 in the UVB-arm for a slit width of 1\farcs{0}, 7450 and 5300 in the VIS- and NIR arms, respectively for a slit width of 0\farcs{9}. For one observation, slit widths of 1\farcs{3} for UVB and 1\farcs{2} for VIS and NIR have been used thus lovering the nominal resolution. The seeings were photometric, reaching 0\farcs{66} as determined from the width of the trace at 7825~\AA~ and therefore the delivered effective resolution will be higher than tabulated. We determine the instrumental spectral seeing FWHM using MOLECFIT (\cite{Smette2015}; \cite{Kausch2015})where a model atmosphere is convolved with a Gaussian kernel and a fit against the telluric absorption bands in the visual arm is done for the width of the Gaussian kernel. The size of the kernel used increases linearly with wavelength to keep the resolution constant as is the case for X-shooter and the FWHM values are related to the central wavelength, which in the case for the visual arm is at 7825~\AA. 


%===========================================================================
\begin{figure}[hbtp]

  \caption[]{Measured spatial seeing from width of trace against effective spectral resolution. All the observations are seeing-limited and thus the effective resolution will be higher than tabulated. (see text). \jstodo{Re-iterate figure} }
\figlabel{seeing}
\end{figure}
%===========================================================================



As can be seen from \fig{seeing}, our observations are done at resolutions between 11000 and 14500 in the visual arm, all of them significantly higher than the nominal values. If we assume that the ratio of measured spatial seeing FWHM to spectral seeing FWHM measured in the visual arm remains constant we get the resolution in UVB and VIS from the width of the traces in the respective arms taking into account the different pixel-scale in the NIR arm. 

\qtodo{Johannes, the X-shooter Messiah, says this is fishy! You should definitely check up on this!}

The spectral resolution is the spatial resolution convolved with the diffraction resolution (intrinsic spectral resolution). For very narrow intrinsic resolutions the corresponding Gaussian can be approximated by a Delta function. A Gaussian convolved with a delta-function leaves the gaussian unchanged. If this is the case, then the assumption I do is correct. 

\begin{eqnarray}
f_{spectral} = f_{spatial} \ast f_{grating}
\end{eqnarray}

If $f_{grating}$ is delta and this is the whole story, then what we do is correct. This could easily be checked by actually calculating the spectral resolution in the NIR arm.  


We find the average resolutions for the observations: R$_{UVB}$ = 5150, R$_{VIS}$ = 12750, R$_{NIR}$= 8350. The resolution is important for the construction of the composite since we need to rebin the spectra to a common dispersion at a common redshift keeping the sampling of the pixels at the optimal Nyquist sampling (2 pixels per FWHM). 

In pixel values we find a different spectral FWHM than spatial FWHM. These values should in principle be the same, but because X-shooter is an eschelle spectrograph, the seeing FWHM

The data were reduced using the ESO/X-shooter pipeline v2.5.2 {\color{red} Reference needed} using the Reflex interface \citep{Freudling2013}. The spectra have been rectified on a grid with 0.2 \AA/pixel in the UVB and VIS arm and 0.6 \AA/pixel in the NIR arm, thus slightly oversampling even the highest-resolution spectra without introducing too much correlation between adjacent pixels in the rectification. The spectra were extracted by simple integration in the nodding window of the rectified image and were flux calibrated using photometric standards (\cite{Vernet2010}; \cite{Hamuy1994}). The seeing of the observations was significantly below the slit width used and slit losses will therefore be negligible. To double-check the accuracy of the flux calibration we download the corresponding spectra observed by SDSS \citep{Ahn2014} and overplotted on the X-shooter observations. Slight variations in individual spectra are detected in both flux level and apparent slope on the $\lesssim$10~percent level. This can both be attributed to erroneous flux calibration in one of the spectra or intrinsic object variability, which is observed to be of this order (\cite{MacLeod2012}; \cite{Morganson2014}. We discuss this in more detain in \sect{systematics}.

Telluric observations of hot dwarfs were taken close in time to allow for an accurate telluric correction which depends heavily on the atmospheric conditions at the time of observation. We now describe the process of telluric correction in more detail

%====================================================================
\subsection{Telluric Correction}   \sectlabel{telluric}
%====================================================================
\jstodo{Rough draft. Needs to be re-iterated.}

All ground based instruments suffer from atmospheric absorption. This is especially true in the Visual (VIS) and Near-Infra-Red (NIR) arm of X-shooter where there are regions of severe telluric absorption from water vapor. 
Because of our limited sample-size, it is desirable to avoid simply masking out regions of atmospheric absorption, but rather correct for them and therefore we investigate which of several methods of telluric correction that maximizes our S/N without introducing artifacts. (molecfit, xsh-library method, my method). 
To correct for this absorption you need an exact measure of the transmission of the atmosphere at the time of your observation. 
The amount of absorption is heavily dependent on the exact conditions through the atmosphere and these changes on very short timescales. This transmission has been modeled as a function of airmass and precipitable water vapor and synthetic transmission-spectra are accessible via the web application SKYCALC developed by ESO. 
 Another take, MOLECFIT, at determining the transmission of the atmosphere is by directly fitting the telluric abortion region with a radiative transfer code thus simultaneously also fitting for the molecular content of the atmosphere. 
 Here the initial guess on the atmospheric conditions are taken from the header of the observation. 
 For a given atmospheric model the molecular content can then be varied and convolved with a instrument-specific kernel to obtain the correct instrumental profile.

%===========================================================================



In the method employed by the Xshooter-Spectral-Library (XSL), \citep{Chen2014}, a library of telluric transmission are creating from observations of featureless telluric standard stars. For each observation an optimal template is found from the POLLUX library of model stellar atmospheres, excluding the regions of telluric absorption in the fit, thus tracing the intrinsic stellar spectral shape. This optimal template is then divided by the object spectrum to create a transmission spectrum. These transmission-curves are then compiled in a library of corrections. When the telluric correction are to be made on the object the regions of telluric regions are fit for the template to find the optimal transmission, regardless of the temporal similarity of the transmission-curve and the object spectrum. The method we use is closely related to the one employed by XSL. We have observations of telluric standard stars close in time to the science observation. To get the transmission-curve from the telluric observations we find the optimal template among the model atmospheres of G\"ottingen Spectral Library \citep{Husser2013}. Here they have used the PHOENIX model stellar atmosphere code to create a grid of synthetic spectra in terms of effective temperature, metallicity and alpha element enhancement. To find the optimal template we simultaneusly fit for the instrumental profile broadening, velocity shift and optimal template using the penalized-pixel fitting software pPXF \citep{Cappellari2004} to find the linear combination of spectra and spectral broadening that minimizes $\chi ^2$ between our object spectrum and the found template . For the fitting we exclude all regions of strong telluric absorption since we only want to trace the continuum. This way of doing the optimal template fit risks finding an unphysical model since we have not constrained the allowed model stellar atmospheres. The reason for doing this is that we want trace the signal as well as possible regardless of the actual shape. An alternative would be non-parametric regression, but here we would loose potential stellar features in the masked regions. !!!Investige reason for uncorrectly traced object(8400\r{A}). As can be seen in \fig{telluric_qc}, the telluric standard spectrum is traced relatively well. The regions where the object is not found accurately will produce an erroneous transmission correction and introduce an error in the resulting composite spectrum. We review the consequences of this later.

\section{Composite Construction}   \sectlabel{construct}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There is not a unique way to construct a composite and the final result is influenced by the chosen way. In the following we describe how we have constructed the composite.

%====================================================================
\subsection{Determining the redshift}  \sectlabel{redshifts}
%====================================================================

Getting the systemic redshift of quasars from emission lines is complicated by the complex physical structure in which they emitted. For the bright quasars selected for our composite many of the prominent high-ionization lines visible will arise in hot clouds with large peculiar velocities and will therefore be affected by systematic line-shifts {\color{red} Reference needed}. To get a redshift closer to the systemic we choose \oiii,$\lambda$5007,  arising in the narrow-line region and therefore less affected by systematic offsets, {\color{red} Reference needed} to fit for the redshift. \oiii~ is situated on a broad Fe-complex and slightly blended with \oiii,$\lambda$4959 and \hb, with \hb~ both containing broad and narrow components. 

To get an accurate estimate of the redshift we mark both sides of the line belonging to \oiii,$\lambda$5007 where it starts to become blended, do a low order polynomial fit to the edges and subtract this pseudo-continuum. We define a Gaussian in terms of the rest wavelength of \oiii~ and leave the redshift as a free parameter and then fit to the line where a weighted minimization of the residuals is done using least squares and the confidence intervals on the best-fit parameters is determined by resampling from a multivariate Gaussian with best-fit values as the mean and a covariance matrix which is the estimated Hessian at the minimum. The weights used are the inverse variance, $ w =  \frac{1}{\sigma^2}$, where $\sigma$ is the statistical error of the spectrum. The 1$\sigma$ confidence intervals on the fit parameters are set by the 16th and 84th percentile of the resampling realizations. The formal errors obtained from the fit are bound to be under-estimating the true error, since correlation between the pixels are not taken into account. Least squares minimization do not guarantee to find the global minimum of the residuals, but we check visually that the fit is satisfactory. \oiii,$\lambda$5007 is visible in all of our spectra in varying strength so additional refinement is not needed. As a starting guess for the redshift we use redshifts queried from SDSS and all fits are visually inspected to check if the fitted redshift is an improvement on the position of \oiii,$\lambda$5007. We show the \oiii~ fit in \fig{linefit}, where \hb, \oiii,$\lambda$4959 and \oiii,$\lambda$5007 are clearly detected. Several broad underlying features make it difficult to model the entire complex by the three lines alone and therefore we are only fitting the narrowest component of the \oiii-line, where only the upper part of the total line flux is used in the fit. This is similar to what is done in \citep{VandenBerk2001}. 

A clear velocity offset is visible between the rest-frame determined by \oii and \hb. We take this as an indication of high peculiar velocities in the region of \hb-emitting clouds. 

We convert all laboratory wavelengths to air wavelengths and transform all redshifts to barycentric standard-of-rest for consistent comparison with SDSS. For all of our spectra we find slight corrections to the redshift, based on the \oiii redshift, as is also shown in \tab{targs}. We note that only two out of seven redshifts agree within the errors, but stress that the measured redshifts are not measured in a consistent manner and therefore offsets are expected.

\subsection{Resampling} \sectlabel{rebin}
%====================================================================


Before combination of the spectra can be done, we need to move them to their local frame. Because of the varying redshifts of the objects, the spectra will have their spectral arms of X-shooter overlap at different wavelengths. X-shooter, being a cross-dispersion echelle spectrograph, will have a non-linear dispersion solution and order to conserve the most information without oversampling, we need to choose a representative bin size on which to interpolate our spectra. The largest sampling is in the NIR arm and is $0.6$\r{A}/pix with an average redshift of $z_{avg} = 1.6$ gives us the conservative bin size of $0.4$\r{A}/pix in the rest-frame. Since our spectra have significantly better resolution than the nominal values and the UVB and VIS arms have a sampling of $0.2$\r{A}/pix we will be throwing away spectral information to make sure that we are not oversampling. We create a wavelength grid from 1000-11665\r{A} in steps of 0.4\r{A} giving $\sim$ 16000 spectral elements on which we linearly interpolate our shifted spectra. Since the constituent spectra have different sampling than the target grid, we will introduce additional correlations between neighboring pixels. This is not taken into account in the reported statistical error of each spectrum.  \qtodo{What is the consequence of this?}

\qtodo{Lusso et al. 2015 multiply flux-density by $(1+z)$. Should we do this?}

%====================================================================
\subsection{Extinction} \sectlabel{extinct}
%====================================================================

The spectra are all corrected for galactic extinction. Extinction values are queried from the reddening maps of \citep{Schlegel1998} using the recalibration from \citep{Schlafly2011}. Extinction values in a 2-degree radius around the source is extracted from the map and a arithmetic mean is used for the average value. The reddening law by \citep{Fitzpatrick1999} with the optical total-to-selective extinction ratio $R_v = 3.1$ is used to deredden each spectrum. The average value of the reddening for our objects is small, $E(B-V) = 0.034$, so we expect any residual effect of the galactic extinction to be minimal. 


%====================================================================
\subsection{IGM absorption correction} \sectlabel{igm}
%====================================================================

At redshifts higher than $\sim1.5$, the rest-frame coverage of x-shooter goes to \lyb~and are therefore heavily affected by \lya-forest absorption, blueward of the \lya-line. To recover the continuum we insert evenly spaced points every 50 pixels, blueward of \lya, each point calculated from the median value of the constituent pixel values. This procedure equals binning the spectrum by 50 pixels and using the median value. We then manually delete points that are not sufficiently smoothly varying, signifying points affected by \lya-forest absorption. When the points represents the visually estimated continuum, a linear spline is the used to interpolate between the points onto the sampling of the original wavelength array. We then concatenate this new continuum estimate with the original spectrum, at \lya. The objects SDSS1150-0023, SDSS1236-0331 and SDSS1431+0535 are the ones contributing the compostite at these wavelengths. 

\qtodo{I'm not sure, that this is the right way. Are there any references to support this way?}



%====================================================================
\subsection{Normalisation}  \sectlabel{norm}
%====================================================================

In order to combine the spectra in a meaningful way, we need to put them on equal grounds as not to favor one spectrum over the other and biasing our final spectrum towards a certain kind of shape. Depending on the type of features we are interested in and on the combination method employed, there are different ways to achieve this normalization. Because the spectra have different absolute flux-scales, a popular way to normalize is to order the spectra in increasing wavelength, start with the lowest redshift, scale the entire spectrum by the median value of the flux and in the overlapping region with the next spectrum, scale with the median and then take the average, combining the spectra consecutively, always scaling to overlapping region. The region chosen will affect how the final spectrum will look (\cite{Francis1991}; \cite{Brotherton2000}; \cite{VandenBerk2001}; \cite{Glikman2006}).

 In principle that standard deviation of the composite should reflect the intrinsic variability of constituent spectra, but the region to which we scale will affect this standard deviation. To make the variance reflect the intra-spectral variability the most, the spectra have been scaled in the region with the least intrinsic continuum variability, which decreases with wavelength, at least up to 6000 \AA \citep{VandenBerk2004}. The closest region free of contaminating emission is just redwards of H$_\alpha$ in the region 7000- 7500 \AA. Each spectrum have been divided by the median flux in this region, thus the normalization is independent and the order in which the combination is done does not matter. \qtodo{What does this do for the final result?}

Before any combination is done, all spectra have been run through a filter, where if the change from pixel to pixel is greater than 20 \%, the pixel is flagged and excluded from the combination. This is to exclude noisy pixels and pixels affected too seriously by telluric absorption correction. We have investigated whether this exclusion changes the shape of the combined continuum and no effect was visible. This way of flagging noisy pixels, ensures that we retain as much signal as possible without introducing very noisy isolated pixels. \qtodo{Is this okay to do?}

%====================================================================
\subsection{Combination}  \sectlabel{combine}
%====================================================================

Choosing the right combination method is tricky business and each method has it's pros and cons. The first assumption is that at each pixel, that constituent spectra have a Gaussian distribution around a sample mean and that this mean reflects the expectation value of the sample. Since we have a relatively small sample, even investigating whether we have a Gaussian distribution is tricky. To make a crude estimate of normality, we take one pixel along the composite and plot a histogram of the individual constituent pixels. To this distribution we overplot the Gaussian that would arise, if the data was normally distributed. We do this for 50 pixels, where we normalise the pixel values by the median value of the pixels. Since we one have 7 pixels, determining whether the constituent spectra are normally distributed, is a guess at best. We show a crude plot in \fig{normality}, where it is not immediately evident if we are normal. We also run a normality test where we take 1000 pixels from the central part of the spectrum. On each pixel we run a normality test which gives us a 2-sided chi squared probability for the hypothesis test, under the null hypothesis that the sample comes from a normal distribution. With an average of $p = 0.31$ we can a least not reject, that we are sampling from a normal distribution. With a larger sample, this test could significantly be improved, especially the test for normality of the kurtosis, which is unstable below 20 elements in the test. 

\qtodo{This doesn't seem quite right. Any suggestions to adress the issue, of underlying distribution?}

%===========================================================================

  \caption[]{Test for normality in individual pixels. \jstodo{Take the mean of the samples to make the graph more clear}}
 \figlabel{normality}
\end{figure}
%===========================================================================

In the case for uncorrelated pixels the minimal variance point estimation for the sample mean is the inverse variance weighted mean, given again that the pixels can be treated as stochastic variables that follow a normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma_i^2)$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma_i^2$. The inverse variance weighted mean is calculated as:

\begin{eqnarray} \eqlabel{wmean}
\bar{f_{\lambda}} &=& \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( f_{\lambda, i} \sigma_{\lambda, i}^{-2} \right)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_{\lambda, i}^{-2}},
\end{eqnarray}

with the variance of the weighted mean given as: 
 
\begin{eqnarray} \eqlabel{sigma-wmean}
\sigma_{\bar{f_{\lambda}}}^2 &=& \frac{ 1 }{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_{\lambda, i}^{-2}}.
\end{eqnarray}

The echellity of x-shooter makes it necessary to resample the image on a rectified image and this process introduces correlations between adjacent pixels. Since we have again rebinned the pixels to the common pixel scale additional correlation between adjacent pixels will be introduced both the the flux spectrum and in the error spectrum, meaning that we will be underestimating the errors in the resulting composite spectrum where the statistical noise will be hiding in pixel-top-pixel variations. On top of that, since our objects are fairly bright, the Poisson noise in our spectra will be non-negligible and thus we are incorporating the pixels values themselves intro their weight which often leads to biasing the result towards spectra of lower signal-to-noise. We check how the combination method employed affects the qualitative features in our spectrum in \sect{systematics}.

\qtodo{Can fancy statistics be used to improve this, or is there something else we need to consider?}




%====================================================================
\subsection{Absolute magnitudes} \sectlabel{absmag}
%====================================================================

In order to make a meaningful comparison with other composites and to the parent population of quasars, synthetic apparent magnitudes are calculated and then, using the redshift, converted to absolute magnitudes. Synthetic photometry is the process by which the apparent magnitudes in a bandpass is obtained from a spectrum by convolution with the filter quantum efficiency curve \cite{Bessell2005}. Following \citep{Bessell2012, Casagrande2014} we obtain the synthetic AB magnitudes using:

\begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{abmag}
m_{\textmd{AB}_x} &=& -2.5  \frac{\int f_\lambda \,  T_{x}  \, \lambda \,  d\lambda} 
{\int  T_{x} \,  (c / \lambda) \,  d\lambda}  - 48.60,
\end{eqnarray}
 
 
where $f_\lambda (\lambda)$ is the observed flux in units of \fluxunit~ for the spectra shifted to rest(z=0) and $T_{x} $ is the total system fractional throughput in band $x$. This can then be converted to absolute magnitude using:

\begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{absmag}
M_{\textmd{AB}_x} &=& -5 \log_{10} \left[  \frac{D_L }{10 \mathrm{pc}}   \right] + m_{\textmd{AB}_x} ,
\end{eqnarray}
with the \textit{luminosity distance}, $D_L$,  obtained using a standard cosmological calculator\footnote{astropy.cosmology}.
 The largest compilation of quasar absolute magnitudes to date is \cite{Shen2011}, in which $\mathrm{M_i (z=2)}$ for the 105,783 quasars in DR7 is presented. To get the corresponding magnitudes for the composite constituent quasars at z=2, the wavelengths are shifted and the flux scaled correspondingly to conserve flux. Using the SDSS i-band filter transmission curve\footnote{\url{http://classic.sdss.org/dr7/instruments/imager/filters/i.dat}} interpolated to the shifted wavelength together with \eq{abmag} and \eq{absmag} yields the desired quantities. The results are shown in \tab{targets} and comparison is done in \sect{parents}

\section{Results}   \sectlabel{results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


We show the weighted mean composite in \fig{composite}. Characteristic features of quasars are readily visible. We see several prominent emission lines across the entire spectral range which includes both very broad high-ionization lines and narrower low-ionization lines as is typical for quasar spectra, with both broad and narrow lines superposed with multiple components \citep{Baldwin1995}. We have marked the position and name of the most prominent lines and overplotted them in \fig{composite}.  Analysis of the lines are beyond the scope of this paper.

  \figlabel{combined}
 \end{figure*}
 %===========================================================================


As is often seen \citep{Elvis2001}, the continuum level is shrouded by the myriad of emission lines, balmer continuum and Fe-complexes scattered across the entire spectrum, making the intrinsic shape of the continuum difficult to estimate. In \fig{composite}, we plot the composite spectrum on a log-log scale on which a power-law appears as a straight line and a linear trend is clearly seen "by eye". 

The composite spectrum covers from \lyb ~in the bluest part of our spectrum to Pa$\gamma$ in the reddest, where a single power law adequately describes the continuum from \lya~and redwards. Bluewards of \lya~the spectrum is affected by \lya-forest absorption and the spectral continuum is slightly depressed with respect to the power law shape, likely due to continuum absorption which is not corrected by the IGM absorption correction described in \sect{igm}. Between $\sim2000$ \AA~ and $\sim5000$ \AA, excess emission compared with a pure power is detected, consistent with  the \textit{small blue bump} \citep{Wills1985}, which consists of a blend of balmer continuum and \feii ~lines, both broad and narrow.

 A single quasar spectrum is usually modeled by a power-law, $f_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^\alpha$, but a weighted mean spectrum of a sample of power-laws does not, in general, result in a power-law with the slope mean of the individual spectra. In principle a geometric mean of a sample of power-laws should result in a power-law with index being the mean index as is shown in \sect{math}. We compare the composite obtained by taking the geometric mean with that obtained by the weighted average and no significant difference is detected between the two composites. We therefore take the  weighted mean composite as representative of the constituent spectra. This potential cause of systematic error due to combination methods is investigated more in \sect{systematics}.

Regions free of contaminating emission are very scarce and fitting a power-law to the composite in manually specified regions is not guaranteed to reflect the continuum. A quantitative measure of the shape can still be obtained by carefully selecting regions that appear relatively unaffected by emission in excess of the continuum. The regions that cover the widest wavelength range are: 1300 - 1350, 1425 - 1475, 5500 - 5800, 7300 - 7500\AA, which we use to fit both with a single power-law and a broken one, with the break redwards of \hb~at 5700 \AA~as is reported by other authors \citep{VandenBerk2001}. For the single power law we obtain $\alpha_\lambda = -1.699$, where for a broken power law we obtain a spectral index; $\alpha_\lambda = -1.696$ below 5700 \AA, and $\alpha_\lambda = -1.723$ above, consistent with a single power law describing the continuum from  \lya ~to Pa$\gamma$. The break in \cite{VandenBerk2001} is attributed to contamination from the host galaxies and adapting the same interpretation, it is gives support to the assumption about the negligible host galaxy contribution present in the composite presented here. A detailed comparison with existing composites in \sect{comparison}. \qtodo{Anything missing?}


%====================================================================
\subsection{Applicability of the composite}  \sectlabel{application}
%====================================================================


To test the applicability of the composite, it is used to determine the dust content of a sample of three red quasars taken from the HAQ (High A$_V$ QSO) survey. The HAQ survey consists of quasars selected on the basis of their optical colors in SDSS and near-infrared in UKIDDS to identify the reddest and therefore most dust-extincted quasars which are missed by traditional color selection criteria. A complete description of the sample criteria and the data are presented in \citet{Fynbo2013} and \citet{Krogager2015}. The dust content can then be inferred by reddening the composite with an extinction law parameterized by \cite{Gordon2003} to match the object spectrum. The parametrization allows the redshift of the object quasar and the magnitude of visual extinction, A$_V$, to be found by minimizing the residuals between the object and the composite. A detailed description of the fitting method is given in \cite{Krogager2015}.

The three quasars have been selected to have varying amounts of extinction and have differing redshifts. We show the result for quasars HAQ2221+0145, HAQ1115+0333 and HAQ2231+0509 in \fig{application} where the success of matching the composite with quasars of very different shapes is visible. 

Following \cite{Wang2012}, the previous composite used to fit for the dust amount consists of the composite generated by \cite{VandenBerk2001} stitched together with the composite by \cite{Glikman2006} at 3000 \AA. Thus, two different composites built from differing samples have been treated as a single composite. That this has been successful is a testament to the similarity of quasars across a large range of parameters. 
The values obtained with the newly generated composite is entirely consistent with the values published in \cite{Krogager2015}, which is encouraging for the previous use of stitched template. A detailed comparison between the different composites is done in \sect{comparison}.

 \subsection{Intra-spectrum variability}  \sectlabel{variability}
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
 To gauge the intra-spectrum variability, the standard deviation of the flux points at each wavelength divided by the composite reflects the fractional sample variability, where by construction this is minimized at the region chosen for normalization - in this case, just redwards of \ha. The general shape of the variability curve is therefore rather uninformative, but nonetheless valuable information can still be gained by inspection. We show the computed fractional variability in \fig{combined}. The sample variability contains both the temporal variability and the intrinsic population variability which is not possible to separate with single-epoch data and therefore potential conclusions should be wary of this degeneracy.
 Significant variation is visible in the the lines of \civ, \mgii, \oiii~ and lines of hydrogen as well as in the \feii-complexes centered around \hb. From 5800 - 11000 \AA~the continuum variability stays almost constant which could indicate a more stable continuum, both temporally and population-wide \qtodo{Is this pushing it too far?}. An increase in variability is observed redwards of 5800 \AA due to slightly varying power law slopes of the constituent spectra. In the region bluewards of \lya~ the fractional variability reaches 60 percent, testament to the stochastic nature of the lyman alpha forest, but the reader is cautioned that only two spectra contribute significantly at these wavelengths.

\section{Discussion}  \sectlabel{discuss}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The applicability of quasar composites as tools for template matching and dust estimation largely hinges on the ability of the composite to represent an intrinsic target spectrum. The broad usage and success of previous composites largely confirms this ability. That the composites constructed are representative for a large group of differently selected quasars is a testament to the homogeneity of the quasar population and the universality of the emission mechanism.
The remarkable uniformity of the average spectral properties across luminosity and redshift indicate very similar underlying physical mechanisms which can be understood in terms of Eigenvector 1 \citep{Boroson1992, Francis1992} where the Eddington ratio drives the relative strength of the lines and orientation effects influences the observed kinematics of the lines\citep{Shen2014a}. The specific local physical conditions which regulate the accretion rate then accounts for the majority of the inter-quasar variation.






%%We have to be careful with regards to the conclusions and the sample selection. We have selected bright quasars, but we can only say something about the mean of this particular sample and not something about the general population of quasars. If there exists an intrinsic population of quasars who are redder, this effect will be degenerate with dust, and fitting for the dust are not guaranteed to result in robust results. This is of major concern.

%====================================================================
\subsection{Comparison to the parent population}  \sectlabel{parents}
%====================================================================
In this section the comparison to the parent population of quasars is done, which is based on the results from \sect{absmag}.
Figure 1 in \cite{Shen2011} presents the distribution of M$_i(z=2)$ as a function redshift for quasars spectroscopically confirmed from the SDSS, for which the black dots represents about half of the objects and are uniformly selected to $\sim$90 percent completeness \citet{Richards2002, VandenBerk2005}. It is clear that the sample presented here represents some of the brightest quasar between redshift 1 and 2. It is therefore potentially a biased subset of the parent quasar population. Quasars have previously been shown to exhibit a large degree of homogeneity over many orders of magnitude \citep{Dietrich2002}, but this is only true for quasars resembling \textit{average} quasars. To ensure that the targets selected for this sample are not outliers in color, the spectrophotometric colors are compared to those of the quasar population presented in \citet{Paris2014}\footnote{\url{https://www.sdss3.org/dr10/algorithms/qso_catalog.php}}. We show the comparison in \fig{color_comparison}. We first confirm that the quasars selected here are among the intrinsically brightest visible with a 2.8 sigma magnitude distance from the mean. At this luminosity they are also the bluest quasar visible. In \sect{application}, the composite generated here was used to fit for the dust content of quasars with varying degree of extinction and consistent results were obtained as compared with composites generated from other subsamples of the parent population.


 %===========================================================================

Bounding contours in green show the concentration of points estimated by kernel density estimation. The grey points are individual quasars from the SDSS sample which satisfy M$_i$(z=2) $> -29$.

The quasar colors have been marginalized over in the right side where the blue lines are at the position of the composite quasars.}
  \figlabel{color_comparison}
 \end{figure}
 %===========================================================================

Because of the high luminosity of the objects presented here, several differences in the properties are expected as compared to those of the parent quasar population. The physical scales locally are expected to be larger \citep{Bentz2013}, which will make variability timescales longer and variability magnitudes smaller \citep{VandenBerk2004}. Black hole masses as determined from \mgii~increases with luminosity \cite{wu2015} which in turn affects the temperature of the accretion disc \citep{shakura1973} and thereby the position of the "big blue bump" and the degree to which the continuum is well modeled by a single power-law, see also \cite{Lusso2015}. dd








A further bias can, because of the low number statistics used for the sample presented, that the targets are not representative for the population fulfilling the cuts imposed in the selection. To test for representativeness against the selection, we construct a composite in an identical fashion consisting of all SDSS quasar fulfilling the selection criteria.

 %===========================================================================




It is also possible to calculate the magnitude correction from z=0 to z=2 following \cite{Richards2006a} Equation (1), in which a pure power law is assumed for the quasar composite. For the i-band, this procedure consistently underestimates the magnitude of the correction, due to the bandpass being shifted to a region with heavy line emission, with a mean underestimation of $0.35 \pm 0.14$ mag, where the uncertainty is the 1-$\sigma$ error.

\subsection{Comparison to existing composites} \sectlabel{comparison}
%====================================================================

A comparison to existing composites is not straightforward due to the different selection criteria that have been employed and thus they are not guaranteed to represent the same population. A qualitative measure of the overall shape can be obtained from doing power-law fits to the continuum, given that the same regions for the fits are used. Since different regions for the fits are selected for the various composites, to do a meaningful comparison, we repeat the the power law fits for the regions employed by the comparison authors \citep{VandenBerk2001, Telfer2002}. 

Continuum shape. Emission and absorption lines. Comparison with existing composites ( Vanden Berk, Glickman). Above 10000 \r{A} only 1 spectrum contribute to compostie and is therefore not well constrained. 


 We have overplotted, in the blue, the weighted mean composte from Vanden Berk and as can be seen there is excellent agreement between the two composites from Ly$\alpha$ at 1216 \AA~ up to H$\gamma$ at 4340 \AA. As is commonly seen in quasar spectra there is a break in the spectrum at around 5000 \r{A}, where there is a significant discrepancy between the slope of the two composites, attributed to the relative contribution of host starlight, where the composite by Vanden Berk consists of low-redshift, intrinsically fainter objects with a higher fraction of host contamination. Does it make sense to fit a powerlaw to this? To quantify we fit power laws to the same regions as used by Vanden Berk and find .. ... .... . Expand this section a lot. Our data is well modelled by a single power law from 5000 \r{A} to 11000 \r{A}.

\subsection{Systematics}  \sectlabel{systematics}
%====================================================================

All studies are affected by systematics. Understanding how the systematics affect the results are imperative to make clear conclusion. We first list the possible systematics that effect the composite in decreasing order of importance and then address each of the points separately to investigate to what degree they affect the final result and their potential consequences.

\end{enumerate}




% Normalisation region
Depending on the region selected for normalization of the individual spectra, the distribution of constituent fluxes at any given wavelength changes. This will mostly affect the absolute scale of the composite and the reported inter-spectrum variability as a function of wavelength, but will also cause the value of the composite at a given wavelength to change. The constituent fluxes are not guaranteed to be distributed normally and therefore the choice of central tendency estimation will affect the value obtained. To investigate how the normalization-window chosen affects the shape of the composite, we have generated composites for varying position of the normalization-window across the entire wavelength range. We have chosen regions clear of strong emission lines. The different combination method yields slightly varying composites as the relative distribution of the fluxes changes for a changing normalization region.

 %===========================================================================

  \figlabel{norm_test}
 \end{figure}
 %===========================================================================


After rescaling the composites to unity at 6850 \AA~ we see very good agreement between the different normalization region. We fit a single power law to the regions specified in \sect{results} and plot the found slope as a function of normalization region in \fig{norm_test} where consistency is clearly visible. 

Composites constructed from the arithmetic mean whose constituent spectra are normalized in the blue are expected to have shallower slopes and therefore appear redder and vice versa for normalization in the red end, because the relative weighting of the different regions changes as a function of normalization region. 

To illustrate this effect we have generated mock quasar spectra from broken power laws with varying slopes, normalizations and lines and constructed the arithmetic mean composites where the constituent spectra have been normalized in different regions. We show the results of this exercise in \fig{mean_test}.

 A clear change in slope is detected with red normalization yielding bluer composites. Here we have scaled the line-strengths with the normalization so the luminosity of the mock spectra does not affect line-strengths and we also see a change in the line strength relative to the continuum level, with the steeper slopes yielding more prominent lines.
 
We do not see this effect to a significant degree in the real quasar composites generated and this supports the use of the weighted mean.

We take the standard deviation of the fitted slopes as the 1-$\sigma$ systematic error due to different normalization region and find a value of: $\sigma_{n} = -1.6855 \pm 0.0334$


%Combination method
What is sought illustrated with the combination method employed is the central tendency of the selected sample, normalized at an optimally chosen region. Since the underlying distribution is unknown, choosing the optimal point estimator for the average flux value is ambiguous. The composite presented in \sect{results} used the weighted arithmetic mean, which was chosen because it is the maximum likelihood estimator, but this combination method has systematic differences from other methods, especially the danger of biasing the composite towards the highest signal-to-noise spectra. 

To test whether we are biased towards high S/N spectra we compare the weighted mean spectrum with that created from the median. We do the comparison by constructing a fractional difference spectrum by dividing the two composites. There is very good agreement between the two composites, with the mean fractional difference is $0.01 \pm 0.05$, where the fractional difference is the ratio between the two composites. This is translated into a "better than 5 percent agreement" between the two different combination method. There not observed a trend with wavelength.

The systematic error in the reported slope due to combination methods is assessed by fitting a single power law in the same regions as in \sect{results} for the different combination methods and in the constituent spectra. We compile the results in \tab{comb_meth}

\input{tabs/combinations.tex} \tablabel{comb_meth} 

The reported errors on $\alpha$ of the different composites are the formal fitting errors from linear least squares fitting without weights and these are severely underestimated, likely due to the regions selected. The error reported on $\alpha$ measured on the individual spectra are more reasonable and all combination methods are consistent within these errors. The values for the individual mean and individual median differ by a small amount and this could suggest a slight skewness in the distribution of slopes, but could also likely just be an artifact of low number statistics. Given that the fitted slopes are consistent supports the use of the weighted mean composite.

In general the mean spectra should not result in an estimated slope with the mean spectral index $\langle a_\lambda\rangle$, see \sect{math}, but what we see here is a very good agreement. To obtain the mean slope the geometric mean which \textit{does} result in the resulting slope equaling the mean slope. The agreement between the different methods are encouraging to the use of the weighted mean.





%Selection effects
Selecting bright quasars with ($r \lesssim 17$) at redshifts $1 < z < 2.1$ are not representative for the intrinsic quasar population \citep{Paris2014} and the final composite is not guaranteed to reflect the properties of quasars at different magnitudes or redshifts. Comparison to the composite by \citep{VandenBerk2001} which consist of lower redshift, intrinsically fainter quasars, show clear differences, which we discuss in section \sect{compsrison}. We test how well our composite match at higher redshift by comparing it to the $z=4.092$ quasar, J0959+1312 in \sect{highz}.

%Flux calibration
As stated in \sect{sample}, we find slight variations in the both absolute flux level and spectral slope of the X-Shooter observed spectra as compared with those observed with SDSS. To test this effect of the $\lesssim$10~percent variation of the accuracy of our flux-calibration compared with the corresponding object spectra obtained with SDSS, we generate a composite from the SDSS spectra alone. Due to larger wavelength coverage of data presented here it is not possible to investigate the residuals and a more qualitative assessment must be made in a shorter wavelength range.
A real resampling within these variations should in principle be done to assess, how this error probagates into the final composite, but this level of detail is beyond the scope of this paper.

%Telluric correction
To test the magnitude of the noise introduced by the telluric correction employed we do the combinations where instead of correcting for the tellurics we exlclude region of telluric absorbtion. The effect on the composite

%Sampling size
To test the effect of the sampling step size chosen we do all the combinations with varying sampling step and we find no difference in the qualitative results. 

 
 
%Host galaxy contamination.
A geometric composite has been generated in bins of luminosity in \citep{Shen2011}, and the evolution of the relative contribution from the host galaxy is evident in their Figure 9, where as can be seen the host contamination for our selection is negligible.

We have reinvented the wheel.

We have generated a quasar composite from 1000 \r{A} to 11000 \r{A} based on X-shooter observations of bright blue quasars at z = 1 - 2. We have confirmed that there is significant host-contamination in the widely employed Vanden Berk composite, and showed the difference this makes for the matching of photometry of red quasars

We show that the geometric mean of a sample power-laws equals a power law with the sample mean index. The geometric mean is a type of mean defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{geometric mean}
\bar{f_{\lambda}} &=&  \left( \prod_{i=1}^n f_{\lambda, i} \right) ^{1/n},
\end{eqnarray}
where the product is over the spectra. If we model each spectrum as a power-law:

\begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{powerlaw}
f_{\lambda, i} &=&  k \lambda ^{\alpha_{i}},
\end{eqnarray}

 we get by inserting \eq{powerlaw} into \eq{geometric mean}:
 
 \begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{deriv1}
 \bar{f_{\lambda}} &=&  \left( \prod_{i=1}^n k \lambda ^{\alpha_{i}}\right) ^{1/n}
 \end{eqnarray}

we rewrite and make the product a sum in the exponent:

 \begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{deriv2}
 \bar{f_{\lambda}} &=&  k \left( \lambda ^{ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_{i}  }\right) ,
 \end{eqnarray}

we see that geometric mean of a sample of power laws is the a power law:

 \begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{deriv3}
 \bar{f_{\lambda}} &=&  k \lambda ^{ \bar{\alpha_{i} }},
 \end{eqnarray}

with the mean index, $\bar{\alpha}$:

 \begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{mean}
 \bar{\alpha} &=&  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_{i} .
 \end{eqnarray}
