abstract = {The similarity of quasar line spectra has been taken as an indication that the emission line clouds have preferred parameters, suggesting that the environment is subject to a fine tuning process. We show here that the observed spectrum is a natural consequence of powerful selection effects. We computed a large grid of photoionization models covering the widest possible range of cloud gas density and distance from the central continuum source. For each line only a narrow range of density and distance from the continuum source results in maximum reprocessing efficiency, corresponding to ``locally optimally-emitting clouds'' (LOC). These parameters depend on the ionization and excitation potentials of the line, and its thermalization density. The mean QSO line spectrum can be reproduced by simply adding together the full family of clouds, with an appropriate covering fraction distribution. The observed quasar spectrum is a natural consequence of the ability of various clouds to reprocess the underlying continuum, and can arise in a chaotic environment with no preferred pressure, gas density, or ionization parameter.},

abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) presents the first spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This ninth data release (DR9) of the SDSS project includes 535,995 new galaxy spectra (median z=0.52), 102,100 new quasar spectra (median z=2.32), and 90,897 new stellar spectra, along with the data presented in previous data releases. These spectra were obtained with the new BOSS spectrograph and were taken between 2009 December and 2011 July. In addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, which determines radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements in temperature estimates for stars with T\_eff<5000 K and in metallicity estimates for stars with [Fe/H]>-0.5. DR9 includes new stellar parameters for all stars presented in DR8, including stars from SDSS-I and II, as well as those observed as part of the SDSS-III Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration-2 (SEGUE-2). The astrometry error introduced in the DR8 imaging catalogs has been corrected in the DR9 data products. The next data release for SDSS-III will be in Summer 2013, which will present the first data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) along with another year of data from BOSS, followed by the final SDSS-III data release in December 2014.},

abstract = {We describe the algorithm for selecting quasar candidates for optical spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Quasar candidates are selected via their nonstellar colors in ugriz broadband photometry and by matching unresolved sources to the FIRST radio catalogs. The automated algorithm is sensitive to quasars at all redshifts lower than z \~{} 5.8. Extended sources are also targeted as low-redshift quasar candidates in order to investigate the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the faint end of the luminosity function. Nearly 95\% of previously known quasars are recovered (based on 1540 quasars in 446 deg 2 ). The overall completeness, estimated from simulated quasars, is expected to be over 90\%, whereas the overall efficiency (quasars/quasar candidates) is better than 65\%. The selection algorithm targets ultraviolet excess quasars to i * = 19.1 and higher redshift ( z \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] \{gtrsim\} 3) quasars to i * = 20.2, yielding approximately 18 candidates deg -2 . In addition to selecting "normal" quasars, the design of the algorithm makes it sensitive to atypical AGNs such as broad absorption line quasars and heavily reddened quasars.},

abstract = {Aims: We present a new library of high-resolution synthetic spectra based on the stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX that can be used for a wide range of applications of spectral analysis and stellar parameter synthesis. Methods: The spherical mode of PHOENIX was used to create model atmospheres and to derive detailed synthetic stellar spectra from them. We present a new self-consistent way of describing micro-turbulence for our model atmospheres. Results: The synthetic spectra cover the wavelength range from 500 \AA to 5.5 $\mu$m with resolutions of R = 500 000 in the optical and near IR, R = 100 000 in the IR and $\Delta$$\lambda$ = 0.1 \AA in the UV. The parameter space covers 2300 K ≤ Teff ≤ 12 000 K, 0.0 ≤ log g ≤ +6.0, - 4.0 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ +1.0, and - 0.2 ≤ [$\alpha$/Fe] ≤ +1.2. The library is a work in progress and we expect to extend it up to Teff = 25 000 K.},

abstract = {We present results on a survey to find extremely dust-reddened Type-1 Quasars. Combining the FIRST radio survey, the 2MASS Infrared Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we have selected a candidate list of 122 potential red quasars. With more than 80\% spectroscopically identified objects, well over 50\% are classified as dust-reddened Type 1 quasars, whose reddenings (E(B-V)) range from approximately 0.1 to 1.5 magnitudes. They lie well off the color selection windows usually used to detect quasars and many fall within the stellar locus, which would have made it impossible to find these objects with traditional color selection techniques. The reddenings found are much more consistent with obscuration happening in the host galaxy rather than stemming from the dust torus. We find an unusually high fraction of Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasars at high redshift, all but one of them belonging to the Low Ionization BAL (LoBAL) class and many also showing absorption the metastable FeII line (FeLoBAL). The discovery of further examples of dust-reddened LoBAL quasars provides more support for the hypothesis that BAL quasars (at least LoBAL quasars) represent an early stage in the lifetime of the quasar. The fact that we see such a high fraction of BALs could indicate that the quasar is in a young phase in which quasar feedback from the BAL winds is suppressing star formation in the host galaxy.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present data and initial results from VLT/X-Shooter emission-line spectroscopy of 96 GRB-selected galaxies at 0.1<z<3.6, the largest sample of GRB host spectroscopy available to date. Most of our GRBs were detected by Swift and 76\% are at 0.5<z<2.5 with a median z\~{}1.6. Based on Balmer and/or forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and neon, we measure systemic redshifts, star formation rates (SFRs), visual attenuations, oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H)), and emission-line widths. We find a strong change of the typical physical properties of GRB hosts with redshift. The median SFR, for example, increases from \~{}0.6 M\_sun/yr at z\~{}0.6 up to \~{}15 M\_sun/yr at z\~{}2. A higher ratio of [OIII]/[OII] at higher redshifts leads to an increasing distance of GRB-selected galaxies to the locus of local galaxies in the BPT diagram. Oxygen abundances of the galaxies are distributed between 12+log(O/H)=7.9 and 12+log(O/H)=9.0 with a median of 12+log(O/H)\~{}8.5. The fraction of GRB-selected galaxies with super-solar metallicities is around 20\% at z<1 in the adopted metallicity scale. This is significantly less than the fraction of star formation in similar galaxies, illustrating that GRBs are scarce in high-metallicity environments. At z\~{}3, sensitivity limits us to probing only the most luminous GRB hosts for which we derive metallicities of Z \~{}< 0.5 Z\_sun. Together with a high incidence of galaxies with similar metallicity in our sample at z\~{}1.5, this indicates that the metallicity dependence observed at low redshift will not be dominant at z\~{}3.},

The MIR color-redshift relation is characterized to z=3, with predictions to z=7. We demonstrate how combining MIR and optical colors can yield even more efficient selection of active galactic nuclei (AGN) than MIR or optical colors alone. Composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are constructed for 259 quasars with both Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Spitzer photometry, supplemented by near-IR, GALEX, VLA and ROSAT data where available. We discuss how the spectral diversity of quasars influences the determination of bolometric luminosities and accretion rates; assuming the mean SED can lead to errors as large as a factor of 2 for individual quasars. Finally, we show that careful consideration of the shape of the mean quasar SED and its redshift dependence leads to a lower estimate of the fraction of reddened/obscured AGNs missed by optical surveys as compared to estimates derived from a single mean MIR to optical flux ratio.},

abstract = {We present a sample of 120 dust-reddened quasars identified by matching radio sources detected at 1.4 GHz in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters survey with the near-infrared Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog and color-selecting red sources. Optical and/or near-infrared spectroscopy provide broad wavelength sampling of their spectral energy distributions that we use to determine their reddening, characterized by E(B – V). We demonstrate that the reddening in these quasars is best described by Small-Magellanic-Cloud-like dust. This sample spans a wide range in redshift and reddening (0.1  z  3, 0.1  E(B – V)  1.5), which we use to investigate the possible correlation of luminosity with reddening. At every redshift, dust-reddened quasars are intrinsically the most luminous quasars. We interpret this result in the context of merger-driven quasar/galaxy co-evolution where these reddened quasars are revealing an emergent phase during which the heavily obscured quasar is shedding its cocoon of dust prior to becoming a normal blue quasar. When correcting for extinction, we find that, depending on how the parent population is defined, these red quasars make up  15\%-20\% of the luminous quasar population. We estimate, based on the fraction of objects in this phase, that its duration is 15\%-20\% as long as the unobscured, blue quasar phase.},

abstract = {Using a sample of 3814 quasars from the Early Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we confirm that high-ionization, broad emission lines, such as C IV , are significantly blueshifted with respect to low-ionization, broad emission lines, such as Mg II , which are thought to be close to the systemic redshift. We examine the velocity shifts of the Mg II and C IV emission lines with respect to [O III ] and Mg II , respectively. C IV emission-line peaks have a range of shifts from a redshift of 500 km s -1 to blueshifts well in excess of 2000 km s -1 as compared with Mg II . We confirm previous results that suggest an anticorrelation between the shift of the C IV emission-line peak and the rest equivalent width of the C IV emission line. Furthermore, by creating composite quasar spectra as a function of C IV shift, we are able to study in detail the profiles of the line as a function of velocity shift. We find that the apparent shift of the C IV emission-line peak is not a shift so much as it is a lack of flux in the red wing for the composite with the largest apparent shift. This observation should strongly constrain models for the broad emission-line region in quasars. The emission-line blueshift and equivalent width of C IV are also discussed in light of the well-known anticorrelation between the equivalent width of C IV emission and continuum luminosity, otherwise known as the Baldwin effect. We further discuss the C IV emission-line shift as a function of other quasar properties, such as spectral index, radio and X-ray detection. We find a possible correlation between the C IV emission-line shifts and the radio properties of the quasars, which is suggestive of orientation as the cause of the C IV velocity shifts. Finally, we explore whether the C IV emission-line blueshifts correlate with the presence of broad absorption line absorption troughs or with narrow, "associated" absorption, and how these might be related to orientation.},

Using the HpHp passband, we adjusted the absolute flux levels of stars in the spectrophotometric libraries so that their synthetic HpHp magnitudes matched the precise Hipparcos Catalogue value. Synthetic photometry based on the renormalized fluxes was compared with the standard UBVRIUBVRI, BTBT and VTVT magnitudes, and revised synthetic zero points were determined. The Hipparcos and Tycho photometry system zero points were also compared with the VV-magnitude zero points of the SAAO UBVRIUBVRI system, the homogenized UBVUBV system, and the Walraven VBVB system. The confusion in the literature concerning broadband magnitudes, fluxes, passbands, and the choice of appropriate mean wavelengths is detailed and discussed in the Appendix.},

A novel empirical technique which allows the measurement and subtraction of the many Fe II lines in this region is applied to these spectra. Measurements of the strengths of H-beta, forbidden O III 5007, and He 4686, and a 4D parameterization of the H-beta profile are combined with optical, radio, and X-ray continuum information from the literature to elucidate how these properties are related. It is concluded that the dominant source of variation in the observed properties of low-redshift QSOs is a physical parameter which balances Fe II excitation against the illumination of the narrow line region. It is argued that this property is not driven by external orientation, i.e., the viewing angle. A comparison of subsamples defined by their radio properties suggest that radio-quiet and radio-loud objects cannot be parallel sequences because there is a large deficit of radio-quiet analogs to the steep-spectrum QSOs.},

The sample extends from i=15 to 19.1 at z<\~{}3 and to i=20.2 for z>\~{}3. The number counts and luminosity function agree well with the results of the Two Degree Field QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ) at redshifts and luminosities at which the SDSS and 2QZ quasar samples overlap, but the SDSS data probe to much higher redshifts than does the 2QZ sample. The number density of luminous quasars peaks between redshifts 2 and 3, although uncertainties in the selection function in this range do not allow us to determine the peak redshift more precisely. Our best-fit model has a flatter bright-end slope at high redshift than at low redshift. For z<2.4 the data are best fit by a redshift-independent slope of $\beta$=-3.1 [$\Phi$(L)\~{}L$\beta$]. Above z=2.4 the slope flattens with redshift to $\beta$>\~{}-2.37 at z=5. This slope change, which is significant at the >\~{}5 $\sigma$ level, must be accounted for in models of the evolution of accretion onto supermassive black holes.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making ...},

abstract = {We explore the form of extragalactic reddening toward quasars using a sample of 9566 quasars with redshifts 0\&lt;z\&lt;2.2 and accurate optical colors from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We confirm that dust reddening is the primary explanation for the red ``tail'' of the color distribution of SDSS quasars. Our fitting to five-band photometry normalized by the modal quasar color as a function of redshift shows that this tail is well described by SMC-like reddening but not by reddening that is LMC-like, Galactic, or as recently described by Gaskell and coworkers. Extension to longer wavelengths using a subset of 1886 SDSS-Two Micron All Sky Survey matches confirms these results at high significance. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations that match the observed distribution of quasar spectral energy distributions using a Lorentzian dust-reddening distribution; 2\% of quasars selected by the main SDSS targeting algorithm (i.e., that are not extincted out of the sample) have EB-V\&gt;0.1, and less than 1\% have EB-V\&gt;0.2, where the extinction is relative to quasars with modal colors. Reddening is uncorrelated with the presence of intervening narrow-line absorption systems, but reddened quasars are much more likely to show narrow absorption at the redshift of the quasar than are unreddened quasars. Thus the reddening toward quasars is dominated by SMC-like dust at the quasar redshift.},

abstract = {Using a sample of over 25,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we show how quasar variability in the rest-frame optical/UV regime depends on rest-frame time lag, luminosity, rest wavelength, redshift, the presence of radio and X-ray emission, and the presence of broad absorption line systems. Imaging photometry is compared with three-band spectrophotometry obtained at later epochs spanning time lags up to about 2 yr. The large sample size and wide range of parameter values allow the dependence of variability to be isolated as a function of many independent parameters. The time dependence of variability (the structure function) is well fitted by a single power law with an index $\gamma$ = 0.246 ± 0.008, on timescales from days to years. There is an anticorrelation of variability amplitude with rest wavelength—e.g., quasars are about twice as variable at 1000 \AA as at 6000 \AA—and quasars are systematically bluer when brighter at all redshifts. There is a strong anticorrelation of variability with quasar luminosity—variability amplitude decreases by a factor of about 4 when luminosity increases by a factor of 100. There is also a significant positive correlation of variability amplitude with redshift, indicating evolution of the quasar population or the variability mechanism. We parameterize all of these relationships. Quasars with ROSAT All-Sky Survey X-ray detections are significantly more variable (at optical/UV wavelengths) than those without, and radio-loud quasars are marginally more variable than their radio-quiet counterparts. We find no significant difference in the variability of quasars with and without broad absorption line troughs. Currently, no models of quasar variability address more than a few of these relationships. Models involving multiple discrete events or gravitational microlensing are unlikely by themselves to account for the data. So-called accretion disk instability models are promising, but more quantitative predictions are needed.},

Luminosity-dependent mean SEDs show that, relative to the high-luminosity SED, low-luminosity SEDs exhibit a harder (bluer) far-UV spectral slope ($\alpha$ UV ), a redder optical continuum, and less hot dust. Mean SEDs constructed instead as a function of UV emission line properties reveal changes that are consistent with known Principal Component Analysis trends. A potentially important contribution to the bolometric correction is the unseen extreme UV (EUV) continuum. Our work suggests that lower-luminosity quasars and/or quasars with disk-dominated broad emission lines may require an extra continuum component in the EUV that is not present (or much weaker) in high-luminosity quasars with strong accretion disk winds. As such, we consider four possible models and explore the resulting bolometric corrections. Understanding these various SED-dependent effects will be important for accurate determination of quasar accretion rates.},

abstract = {We present the final catalogue of the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ), based on Anglo-Australian Telescope 2dF spectroscopic observations of 44576 colour-selected (u b\_J r) objects with 18.25<b\_J<20.85 selected from APM scans of UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) photographic plates. The 2QZ comprises 23338 QSOs, 12292 galactic stars (including 2071 white dwarfs) and 4558 compact narrow-emission-line galaxies. We obtained a reliable spectroscopic identification for 86 per cent of objects observed with 2dF. We also report on the 6dF QSO Redshift Survey (6QZ), based on UKST 6dF observations of 1564 brighter 16<b\_J<18.25 sources selected from the same photographic input catalogue. In total, we identified 322 QSOs spectroscopically in the 6QZ. The completed 2QZ is, by more than a factor 50, the largest homogeneous QSO catalogue ever constructed at these faint limits (b\_J<20.85) and high QSO surface densities (35 QSOs deg\^{}-2). As such it represents an important resource in the study of the Universe at moderate-to-high redshifts. As an example of the results possible with the 2QZ, we also present our most recent analysis of the optical QSO luminosity function and its cosmological evolution with redshift. For a flat, Omega\_m=0.3 and Omega\_lam=0.7, Universe, we find that a double power law with luminosity evolution that is exponential in look-back time, t, of the form L*(z) exp(6.15t), equivalent to an e-folding time of 2Gyr, provides an acceptable fit to the redshift dependence of the QSO luminosity function over the range 0.4 < z < 2.1 and M\_bJ<-22.5. Evolution described by a quadratic in redshift is also an acceptable fit, with L*(z)\~{}10\^{}(1.39z-0.29z\^{}2).},

The spectrum is derived from 718 individual spectra obtained as part of the Large Bright Quasar Survey. The moderate resolution, 4A or less, and high signal-to-noise ratio allow numerous weak emission features to be identified. Of particular note is the large equivalent-width of the Fe II emission in the rest-frame ultraviolet and the blue continuum slope of the composite. The primary aim of this paper is to provide a reference spectrum for use in line identifications, and a series of large-scale representations of the composite spectrum are shown. A measure of the standard deviation of the individual quasar spectra from the composite spectrum is also presented.},

abstract = {Quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) whose spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are reddened by dust either in their host galaxies or in intervening absorber galaxies are to a large degree missed by optical color selection criteria like the ones used by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To overcome this bias against red QSOs, we employ a combined optical and near-infrared (near-IR) color selection. In this paper, we present a spectroscopic follow-up campaign of a sample of red candidate QSOs which were selected from the SDSS and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). The spectroscopic data and SDSS/UKIDSS photometry are supplemented by mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. In our sample of 159 candidates, 154 (97\%) are confirmed to be QSOs. We use a statistical algorithm to identify sightlines with plausible intervening absorption systems and identify nine such cases assuming dust in the absorber similar to Large Magellanic Cloud sightlines. We find absorption systems toward 30 QSOs, 2 of which are consistent with the best-fit absorber redshift from the statistical modeling. Furthermore, we observe a broad range in SED properties of the QSOs as probed by the rest-frame 2 $\mu$ m flux. We find QSOs with a strong excess as well as QSOs with a large deficit at rest-frame 2 $\mu$ m relative to a QSO template. Potential solutions to these discrepancies are discussed. Overall, our study demonstrates the high efficiency of the optical/near-IR selection of red QSOs.},

abstract = {We describe the design, construction, and performance of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope located at Apache Point Observatory. The telescope is a modified two-corrector Ritchey-Chr\'{e}tien design with a 2.5 m, f/2.25 primary, a 1.08 m secondary, a Gascoigne astigmatism corrector, and one of a pair of interchangeable highly aspheric correctors near the focal plane, one for imaging and the other for spectroscopy. The final focal ratio is f/5. The telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, multiband CCD camera and a pair of fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include the following: (1) A 3° diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has excellent image quality and small geometric distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000-10,600 \AA) in the imaging mode, and good image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging. (2) Very high precision motion to support open-loop TDI observations. (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs. The telescope had first light in 1998 May and began regular survey operations in 2000.},

abstract = {We investigate the continuum and emission line properties of 4576 SDSS quasars as a function of their optical/UV SEDs. The optical/UV color distribution of our sample is roughly Gaussian, but with a red tail; we distinguish between 1) intrinsically blue (optically flat) quasars, 2) intrinsically red (optically steep) quasars, and 3) the 273 (6\%) of our quasars whose continua are inconsistent with a single power-law and appear redder due to SMC-like dust reddening rather than synchrotron emission. The color distribution suggests that the population of moderately dust reddened broad-line quasars is smaller than that of unobscured quasars, but we estimate that a further 10\% of the luminous quasar population is missing from the SDSS sample because of dust extinction with E(B-V)<0.5. We also investigate the emission and absorption line properties of these quasars as a function of color with regard to Boroson \& Green type eigenvectors. Intrinsically red (optically steep) quasars tend to have narrower Balmer lines and weaker CIV, CIII], HeII and 3000A bump emission as compared with bluer (optically flatter) quasars. The change in strength of the 3000A bump appears to be dominated by the Balmer continuum and not by FeII emission. The dust reddened quasars have even narrower Balmer lines and weaker 3000A bumps, in addition to having considerably larger equivalent widths of [OII] and [OIII] emission. The fraction of broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs) increases from \~{}3.4\% for the bluest quasars to perhaps as large as 20\% for the dust reddened quasars, but the intrinsic color distribution is affected by dust reddening.

abstract = {We report on the analysis of a large sample of 744 type 1 active galactic nuclei, including quasars and Seyfert 1 galaxies across the redshift from 0  z  5 and spanning nearly 6 orders of magnitude in continuum luminosity. We discuss correlations of continuum and emission-line properties in the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral ranges. The well-established Baldwin effect is detected for almost all emission lines from O VI $\lambda$1034 to [O III] $\lambda$5007. Their equivalent widths are significantly anticorrelated with the continuum strength, while they are nearly independent of redshift. This is the well-known Baldwin effect. Its slope $\beta$, measured as log W$\lambda$  $\beta$ log $\lambda$L$\lambda$(1450 \AA), shows a tendency to become steeper toward higher luminosity. The slope of the Baldwin effect also increases with the ionization energy needed to create the individual lines. In contrast to this general trend, the N V $\lambda$1240 equivalent width is nearly independent of continuum luminosity and remains nearly constant. The overall line behaviors are consistent with softer UV continuum shapes and perhaps increasing gas metallicity in more luminous active galactic nuclei.},

For the full sample the power-law index in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) between 350 and 1050 A is alpha = -1.96. The continuum flux in the wavelengths near the Lyman limit shows a depression of about 10 percent. The break in the power-law index and the slight depression of the continuum near the Lyman limit are features expected in Comptonized accretion-disk spectra.},

abstract = {The ionizing continuum from active galactic nuclei is fundamental for interpreting their broad emission lines and understanding their impact on the surrounding gas. Furthermore, it provides hints on how matter accretes on to supermassive black holes. Using Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3, we have constructed the first stacked ultraviolet (rest-frame wavelengths 600-2500 A) spectrum of 53 luminous quasars at z [\~{}=] 2.4, with a state-of-the-art correction for the intervening Lyman forest and Lyman continuum absorption. The continuum slope ([IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">) of the full sample shows a break at [\~{}]912 A with spectral index \{nu\} = -0.61 \{+/-\} 0.01 at \{lambda\} > 912 A and a softening at shorter wavelengths (\{nu\} = -1.70 \{+/-\} 0.61 at \{lambda\} [\&le;] 912 A). Our analysis proves that a proper intergalactic medium absorption correction is required to establish the intrinsic continuum emission of quasars. We interpret our average ultraviolet spectrum in the context of photoionization, accretion disc models, and quasar contribution to the ultraviolet background. We find that observed broad line ratios are consistent with those predicted assuming an ionizing slope of ion = -2.0, similar to the observed ionizing spectrum in the same wavelength range. The continuum break and softening are consistent with accretion disc plus X-ray corona models when black hole spin is taken into account. Our spectral energy distribution yields a 30 per cent increase to previous estimates of the specific quasar emissivity, such that quasars may contribute significantly to the total specific Lyman limit emissivity estimated from the Ly forest at z < 3.2.},

Consistent with our initial results, we find our selection criteria -- J-K>1.7, R-K>4.0 -- yield a \~{}50\% success rate for discovering quasars substantially redder than those found in optical surveys. Comparison with UVX- and optical color-selected samples shows that >\~{} 10\% of the quasars are missed in a magnitude-limited survey. Simultaneous two-frequency radio observations for part of the sample indicate that a synchrotron continuum component is ruled out as a significant contributor to reddening the quasars' spectra. We go on to estimate extinctions for our objects assuming their red colors are caused by dust. Continuum fits and Balmer decrements suggest E(B-V) values ranging from near zero to 2.5 magnitudes. Correcting the K-band magnitudes for these extinctions, we find that for K <= 14.0, red quasars make up between 25\% and 60\% of the underlying quasar population; owing to the incompleteness of the 2MASS survey at fainter K-band magnitudes, we can only set a lower limit to the radio-detected red quasar population of >20-30\%.},

abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 $\mu$m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 $\mu$m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 $\mu$m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 $\mu$m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 $\mu$m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 $\mu$m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 ± 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 $\mu$m and of 17 ± 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 $\mu$m (95\% confidence). This integrated flux \~{}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 $\mu$m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

abstract = {Velocity-resolved reverberation mapping suggests that the broad-line regions (BLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can have significant net inflow. We use the STOKES radiative transfer code to show that electron and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and torus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization lines and the ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the geometry of the scattering region. If correct, then this model resolves the long-standing conflict between the absence of outflow implied by velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow if the blueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the inflow is sufficient to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the outer accretion disk and that similar magnetohydrodynamic processes are operating. In the scattering model, the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so high-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts, as is observed. Scattering can lead to systematically too high black hole mass estimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities between narrow-line region (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have a similar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad absorption line QSOs if they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from the BLR and torus could be more important in the UV than electron scattering for predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance of Rayleigh scattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line profiles at different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region.},

abstract = {We have created a variety of composite quasar spectra using a homogeneous data set of over 2200 spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The quasar sample spans a redshift range of 0.044 <= z <= 4.789, and an absolute r' magnitude range of -18.0 to -26.5. The median composite covers a rest wavelength range from 800 - 8555A, and reaches a peak signal-to-noise ratio of over 300 per 1A resolution element in the rest frame. We have identified over 80 emission line features in the spectrum. Emission line peak velocity shifts of the broad permitted and semi-forbidden lines are strongly correlated with ionization energy, as previously suggested, but we find that the narrow forbidden lines are also shifted by amounts which are strongly correlated with ionization energy. The magnitude of the forbidden line shifts is < 100 km/s, compared to shifts of up to 550 km/s for some of the permitted and semi-forbidden lines. At wavelengths longer than the Ly-a emission, the continuum of the geometric mean composite is well-fit by two power-laws, with a break at approximately 5000A. The frequency power law index, alpha\_nu, is -0.44 from 1300 - 5000A, and -2.45 redward of about 5000A. The abrupt change in slope can be accounted for partly by host galaxy contamination at low redshift. Stellar absorption lines, including higher-order Balmer lines, seen in the composites suggest that young or intermediate age stars make a significant contribution to the light of the host galaxies. An electronic table of the median quasar template is available.},

The objects were selected from all regions of color space, sparsely sampled from within a 278 deg 2 area (effective area 233 deg 2 ) of sky covered by this study. Only 10 quasars were identified that were not targeted as candidates by the SDSS quasar survey (including both color and radio source selection). The inferred density of unresolved quasars on the sky that are missed by the SDSS algorithm is 0.44 deg -2 , compared with 8.28 deg -2 for the selected quasar density, giving a completeness of 94.9 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/129/5/2047/img1.gif] \% to the limiting magnitude. Omitting radio selection reduces the color-only selection completeness by about 1\%. Of the 10 newly identified quasars, three have detected broad absorption line systems, six are significantly redder than other quasars at the same redshift, and four have redshifts between 2.7 and 3.0 (the redshift range where the SDSS colors of quasars intersect the stellar locus). The fraction of quasars (and other unresolved sources) missed because of image defects and blends, independent of the selection algorithm, is ≈4\%, but this number varies by a few percent with magnitude. Quasars with extended images comprise about 6\% of the SDSS sample, and the completeness of the selection algorithm for extended quasars is approximately 81\%, based on the SDSS galaxy survey. The combined end-to-end completeness for the SDSS quasar survey is ≈89\%. The total corrected density of quasars on the sky to i = 19.1 is estimated to be 10.2 deg -2 . The SDSS completeness restricted to z \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] \{gtrsim\} 3 quasars is expected to be considerably lower and is a strong function of redshift.

The R\_V dependent CCM relationship and the sample of extinction curves used to derive this relationship is used to describe the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction curves are derived from archival IUE data, except for one new SMC extinction curve which was measured using HST/STIS observations. The optical extinction curves are derived from new (for the SMC) and literature UBVRI photometry (for the LMC). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASS photometry supplemented with DENIS and new JHK photometry. For each extinction curve, we give R\_V = A(V)/E(B-V) and N(HI) values which probe the same dust column as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMC extinction curves with the CCM relationship three different ways: each curve by itself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with R\_V, and behavior of the extinction curve FM fit parameters with R\_V. As has been found previously, we find that a small number of LMC extinction curves are consistent with the CCM relationship, but majority of the LMC and all of the SMC curves do not follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we find that the CCM relationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all of the LMC and SMC extinction curves. This result strengthens the picture of dust extinction curves exhibit a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Way and the SMC Bar. (abridged)},

Comparison with the magnitudes of these objects on the POSS-I plates provides by far the largest sample of long-term variability amplitudes for radio-selected quasars yet produced. We find the quasars to be more variable in the blue than in the red band, consistent with work on optically selected samples. The previously noted trend of decreasing variability with increasing optical luminosity applies only to radio-quiet objects. Furthermore, we do not confirm a rise in variability amplitude with redshift, nor do we see any dependence on radio flux or luminosity. The variability over a radio-optical flux ratio range spanning a factor of 60,000 from radio-quiet to extreme radio-loud objects is largely constant, although there is a suggestion of greater variability in the extreme radio-loud objects. We demonstrate the importance of Malmquist bias in variability studies and develop a procedure to correct for the bias in order to reveal the underlying variability properties of the sample.},

abstract = {We combine a large set of quasar luminosity function (QLF) measurements from the rest-frame optical, soft and hard X-ray, and near- and mid-infrared bands to determine the bolometric QLF in the redshift interval z=0-6. Accounting for the observed distributions of quasar column densities and variation of spectral energy distribution (SED) shapes, and their dependence on luminosity, makes it possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and provides a baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any individual survey. We infer the QLF break luminosity and faint-end slope out to z\~{}4.5 and confirm at high significance (>10sigma) previous claims of a flattening in both the faint- and bright-end slopes with redshift. With the best-fit estimates of the column density distribution and quasar SED, which both depend on luminosity, a single bolometric QLF self-consistently reproduces the observed QLFs in all bands and at all redshifts for which we compile measurements. Ignoring this luminosity dependence does not yield a self-consistent bolometric QLF and there is no evidence for any additional dependence on redshift. We calculate the expected relic black hole mass function and mass density, cosmic X-ray background, and ionization rate as a function of redshift and find they are consistent with existing measurements. The peak in the total quasar luminosity density is well-constrained at z=2.15+/-0.05. We provide a number of fitting functions to the bolometric QLF and its manifestations in various bands, and a script to return the QLF at arbitrary frequency and redshift from these fits, as the most simple inferences from the QLF measured in a single band can be misleading.},

abstract = {We have observed 28 local galaxies in the wavelength range between 1 and 2.4 m in order to define template spectra of the normal galaxies along the Hubble sequence. Five galaxies per morphological type were observed in most cases, and the resulting rms spread of the normalized spectra of each class, including both intrinsic differences and observational uncertainties, is about 1 per cent in K, 2 per cent in H and 3 per cent in J. Many absorption features can be accurately measured. The target galaxies and the spectroscopic aperture (7x53 arcsec2) were chosen to be similar to those used by Kinney et al. to define template UV and optical spectra. The two data sets are matched in order to build representative spectra between 0.1 and 2.4 m. The continuum shape of the optical spectra and the relative normalization of the near-IR ones were set to fit the average effective colours of the galaxies of the various Hubble classes. The resulting spectra are used to compute the k-corrections of the normal galaxies in the near-IR bands, and to check the predictions of various spectral synthesis models: while the shape of the continuum is generally well predicted, large discrepancies are found in the absorption lines. Among the other possible applications, here we also show how these spectra can be used to place constraints on the dominant stellar population in local galaxies. Spectra and k-corrections are publicly available and can be downloaded from the web site http://www.arcetri.astro.it/[\~{}]filippo/spectra.},

abstract = {We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame UV spectroscopic properties of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The database of almost 1000 LBG spectra proves useful for constructing high S/N composite spectra. The composite spectrum of the entire sample reveals a wealth of features attributable to hot stars, HII regions, dust, and outflowing neutral and ionized gas. By grouping the database according to galaxy parameters such as Lyman-alpha equivalent width, UV spectral slope, and interstellar kinematics, we isolate some of the major trends in LBG spectra which are least compromised by selection effects. We find that LBGs with stronger Lyman-alpha emission have bluer UV continua, weaker low-ionization interstellar absorption lines, smaller kinematic offsets between Lyman-alpha and the interstellar absorption lines, and lower star-formation rates. There is a decoupling between the dependence of low- and high-ionization outflow features on other spectral properties. Most of the above trends can be explained in terms of the properties of the large-scale outflows seen in LBGs. According to this scenario, the appearance of LBG spectra is determined by a combination of the covering fraction of outflowing neutral gas which contains dust, and the range of velocities over which this gas is absorbing. Higher sensitivity and spectral resolution observations are still required for a full understanding of the covering fraction and velocity dispersion of the outflowing neutral gas in LBGs, and its relationship to the escape fraction of Lyman continuum radiation in galaxies at z\~{}3.},

abstract = {After a pedagogical introduction to the main concepts of synthetic photometry, colours and bolometric corrections in the Johnson-Cousins, 2MASS, and HST-ACS/WFC3 photometric systems are generated from MARCS synthetic fluxes for various [Fe/H] and [/Fe] combinations, and virtually any value of E(B - V) [lsim] 0.7. The successes and failures of model fluxes in reproducing the observed magnitudes are highlighted. Overall, extant synthetic fluxes predict quite realistic broad-band colours and bolometric corrections, especially at optical and longer wavelengths: further improvements of the predictions for the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions await the use of hydrodynamic models where the microturbulent velocity is not treated as a free parameter. We show how the morphology of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) changes for different values of [Fe/H] and [/Fe]; in particular, how suitable colour combinations can easily discriminate between red giant branch and lower main-sequence populations with different [/Fe], due to the concomitant loops and swings in the CMD. We also provide computer programs to produce tables of synthetic bolometric corrections as well as routines to interpolate in them. These colour-Teff-metallicity relations may be used to convert isochrones for different chemical compositions to various bandpasses assuming observed reddening values, thus bypassing the standard assumption of a constant colour excess for stars of different spectral type. We also show how such an assumption can lead to significant systematic errors. The MARCS transformations presented in this study promise to provide important constraints on our understanding of the multiple stellar populations found in globular clusters (e.g. the colours of lower main-sequence stars are predicted to depend strongly on [/Fe]) and of those located towards/in the Galactic bulge.},

abstract = {We use a sample of 332 Hubble Space Telescope spectra of 184 QSOs with z > 0.33 to study the typical ultraviolet spectral properties of QSOs, with emphasis on the ionizing continuum. Our sample is nearly twice as large as that of Zheng et al. (1997) and provides much better spectral coverage in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). The overall composite continuum can be described by a power law with index alpha\_EUV = -1.76 +/- 0.12 (f\_nu \~{} nu\^{}alpha) between 500 and 1200 Angstroms. The corresponding results for subsamples of radio-quiet and radio-loud QSOs are alpha\_EUV = -1.57 +/- 0.17 and alpha\_EUV = -1.96 +/- 0.12, respectively. We also derive alpha\_EUV for as many individual objects in our sample as possible, totaling 39 radio-quiet and 40 radio-loud QSOs. The typical individually measured values of alpha\_EUV are in good agreement with the composites. We find no evidence for evolution of alpha\_EUV with redshift for either radio-loud or radio-quiet QSOs. However, we do find marginal evidence for a trend towards harder EUV spectra with increasing luminosity for radio-loud objects. An extrapolation of our radio-quiet QSO spectrum is consistent with existing X-ray data, suggesting that the ionizing continuum may be represented by a single power law. The resulting spectrum is roughly in agreement with models of the intergalactic medium photoionized by the integrated radiation from QSOs.},

abstract = {We examine recent measurements of the z approximate to 2.5 intergalactic medium (IGM) which constrain the H I frequency distribution f (N-HI) and the mean free path lambda(912)(mfp) to ionizing radiation. We argue that line-blending and the clustering of strong absorption-line systems have led previous authors to systematically overestimate the effective Lyman limit opacity, yielding too small of lambda(912)(mfp) for the IGM. We further show that recently published measurements of f (N-HI) at N-HI approximate to 10(16) cm(-2) lie in strong disagreement, implying underestimated uncertainty from sample variance and/or systematics like line-saturation. Allowing for a larger uncertainty in the f (N-HI) measurements, we provide a new cubic Hermite spline model for f (N-HI) which reasonably satisfies all of the observational constraints under the assumption of randomly distributed absorption systems. We caution, however, that this formalism is invalid in the light of absorber clustering and use a toy model to estimate the effects. Future work must properly account for the non-Poissonian nature of the IGM.},

abstract = {We measure quasar variability using the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 Survey (Pan-STARRS1 or PS1) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and establish a method of selecting quasars via their variability in 104 deg2 surveys. We use 105 spectroscopically confirmed quasars that have been well measured in both PS1 and SDSS and take advantage of the decadal timescales that separate SDSS measurements and PS1 measurements. A power law model fits the data well over the entire time range tested, 0.01-10 yr. Variability in the current PS1-SDSS data set can efficiently distinguish between quasars and nonvarying objects. It improves the purity of a griz quasar color cut from 4.1\% to 48\% while maintaining 67\% completeness. Variability will be very effective at finding quasars in data sets with no u band and in redshift ranges where exclusively photometric selection is not efficient. We show that quasars' rest-frame ensemble variability, measured as a root mean squared in $\Delta$ magnitudes, is consistent with V(z, L, t) = A 0(1 + z)0.37(L/L 0)–0.16(t/1 yr)0.246, where L 0 = 1046 erg s–1 and A 0 = 0.190, 0.162, 0.147, or 0.141 in the g P1, r P1, i P1, or z P1filter, respectively.

The publicly available SDSS quasar redshifts are shown to possess systematic biases of Dz/(1+z)>=0.002 (600km/s) over both small (dz\~{}0.1) and large (dz\~{}1) redshift intervals. Empirical relationships between redshifts based on i) CaII H \& K host galaxy absorption, ii) quasar [OII] 3728, iii) [OIII] 4960,5008 emission, and iv) cross-correlation (with a master quasar template) that includes, at increasing quasar redshift, the prominent MgII 2799, CIII] 1908 and CIV 1549 emission lines, are established as a function of quasar redshift and luminosity. New redshifts in the resulting catalogue possess systematic biases a factor of \~{}20 lower compared to the SDSS redshift values; systematic effects are reduced to the level of Dz/(1+z)<10\^{}-4 (30km/s) per unit redshift, or <2.5x10\^{}-5 per unit absolute magnitude. Redshift errors, including components due both to internal reproducibility and the intrinsic quasar-to-quasar variation among the population, are available for all quasars in the catalogue. The improved redshifts and their associated errors have wide applicability in areas such as quasar absorption outflows, quasar clustering, quasar-galaxy clustering and proximity-effect determinations.},

abstract = {We quantify quasar color variability using an unprecedented variability database—ugriz photometry of 9093 quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82, observed over 8 years at \~{}60 epochs each. We confirm previous reports that quasars become bluer when brightening. We find a redshift dependence of this blueing in a given set of bands (e.g., g and r), but show that it is the result of the flux contribution from less-variable or delayed emission lines in the different SDSS bands at different redshifts. After correcting for this effect, quasar color variability is remarkably uniform, and independent not only of redshift, but also of quasar luminosity and black hole mass. The color variations of individual quasars, as they vary in brightness on year timescales, are much more pronounced than the ranges in color seen in samples of quasars across many orders of magnitude in luminosity. This indicates distinct physical mechanisms behind quasar variability and the observed range of quasar luminosities at a given black hole mass—quasar variations cannot be explained by changes in the mean accretion rate. We do find some dependence of the color variability on the characteristics of the flux variations themselves, with fast, low-amplitude, brightness variations producing more color variability. The observed behavior could arise if quasar variability results from flares or ephemeral hot spots in an accretion disk.},

In this paper, we thoroughly characterize the anomalously steep reddening law in quasars via an exceptional example observed in IRAS 14026+4341. By comparing the observed spectrum to the quasar composite spectrum, we derive a reddening curve in the rest-frame wavelength range of 1200-10000 \AA. It has a steep rise at wavelengths shorter than 3000 \AA, but no significant reddening at longer wavelengths. The absence of dust reddening in the optical continuum is confirmed by the normal broad-line Balmer decrement (the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio) in IRAS 14026+4341. The anomalous reddening curve can be satisfactorily reproduced with a dust model containing silicate grains in a power-law size distribution, dn ( a )/ da \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] \{vprop\} a –1.4 , truncated at a maximum size of a max = 70 nm. The unusual size distribution may be caused by the destruction of large "stardust" grains by quasar activities or a different dust formation mechanism (i.e., the in situ formation of dust grains in quasar outflows). It is also possible that the analogies of the dust grains observed near the Galactic center are responsible for the steep reddening curve. In addition, we find that IRAS 14026+4341 is a weak emission-line quasar (i.e., PHL 1811 analogies) with heavy dust reddening and blueshifted broad absorption lines.},

The catalog includes all BOSS objects that were targeted as quasar candidates during the first 2.5 years of the survey and that are confirmed as quasars via visual inspection of the spectra. The catalog also includes known quasars (mostly from SDSS-I and II) that were reobserved by BOSS. The catalog contains 166,583 quasars (74,454 are new discoveries since SDSS-DR9) detected over 6,373 deg\$\^{}\{2\}\$ with robust identification and redshift measured by a combination of principal component eigenspectra. The number of quasars with \$z>2.15\$ (117,668) is \$\backslash sim\$5 times greater than the number of \$z>2.15\$ quasars known prior to BOSS. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongest emission lines (CIV, CIII, MgII). The catalog identifies 16,461 broad absorption line quasars and gives their characteristics. For each object, the catalog presents five-band (u, g, r, i, z) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag and information on the optical morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3,600-10,500$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ at a spectral resolution in the range 1,300\$<\$R\$<\$2,500; the spectra can be retrieved from the SDSS Catalog Archive Server.

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong H$\delta$ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

Our main goal with the$\backslash$r selection is to search for QSOs reddened by foreground dusty absorber galaxies. For a sample of 58$\backslash$r candidates (including 20 objects fulfilling our selection criteria that already have spectra in the$\backslash$r SDSS), 46 (79\%) are confirmed to be QSOs. The QSOs are predominantly dust-reddened except for a$\backslash$r handful at redshifts z \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] \{gsim\} 3.5. However, the$\backslash$r dust is most likely located in the QSO host galaxies (and for two, the reddening is primarily caused$\backslash$r by Galactic dust) rather than in the intervening absorbers. More than half of the QSOs show evidence$\backslash$r of associated absorption (BAL absorption). Four (7\%) of the candidates turned out to be late-type$\backslash$r stars, and another four (7\%) are compact galaxies. We could not identify the remaining four objects.$\backslash$r In terms of their optical spectra, these QSOs are similar to the QSOs selected in the FIRST-2MASS$\backslash$r Red Quasar Survey except they are on average fainter, more distant, and only two are detected in the$\backslash$r FIRST survey. As per the usual procedure, we estimate the amount of extinction using the SDSS QSO$\backslash$r template reddened by Small-Magellanic-Cloud-(SMC) like dust. It is possible to get a good match to$\backslash$r the observed (rest-frame ultraviolet) spectra, but it is not possible to match the observed near-IR$\backslash$r photometry from UKIDSS for nearly all the reddened QSOs. The most likely reasons are that the SDSS$\backslash$r QSO template is too red at optical wavelengths due to contaminating host galaxy light and because$\backslash$r the assumed SMC extinction curve is too shallow. Three of the compact galaxies display old stellar$\backslash$r populations with ages of several Gyr and masses of about 10 10 M ☉ (based on spectral energy$\backslash$r distribution modeling). The inferred stellar densities in these galaxies exceed 10 10 M ☉ kpc –2 ,$\backslash$r which is among the highest measured for early-type galaxies. Our survey has demonstrated that$\backslash$r selection of QSOs based on near-IR photometry is an efficient way to select QSOs, including reddened$\backslash$r QSOs, with only small contamination from late-type stars and compact galaxies. This will be useful$\backslash$r with ongoing and future wide-field near-IR surveys such as the VISTA and EUCLID surveys.},

abstract = {We provide a quantitative description and statistical interpretation of the optical continuum variability of quasars. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has obtained repeated imaging in five UV-to-IR photometric bands for 33,881 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. About 10,000 quasars have an average of 60 observations in each band obtained over a decade along Stripe 82 (S82), whereas the remaining \~{}25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps. The observed time lags span the range from a day to almost 10 years, and constrain quasar variability at rest-frame time lags of up to 4 years, and at rest-frame wavelengths from 1000 \AA to 6000 \AA. We publicly release a user-friendly catalog of quasars from the SDSS Data Release 7 that have been observed at least twice in SDSS or once in both SDSS and the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, and we use it to analyze the ensemble properties of quasar variability. Based on a damped random walk (DRW) model defined by a characteristic timescale and an asymptotic variability amplitude that scale with the luminosity, black hole mass, and rest wavelength for individual quasars calibrated in S82, we can fully explain the ensemble variability statistics of the non-S82 quasars such as the exponential distribution of large magnitude changes. All available data are consistent with the DRW model as a viable description of the optical continuum variability of quasars on timescales of \~{}5-2000 days in the rest frame. We use these models to predict the incidence of quasar contamination in transient surveys such as those from the Palomar Transient Factory and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how best to correct astronomical data for the wavelength-dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main general features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along with the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of extinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral region, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the wavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between extinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships provide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction. Several strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the uncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the wavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR through the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction law varies with the parameter R = A(V)/E(B-V). These curves represent the true monochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable for dereddening IR--UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution, and can be used to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.},

abstract = {Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) QSO spectra taken at multiple epochs, we find that the composite flux differences in the rest-frame wavelength range 1300-6000 \AA can be fit by a standard thermal accretion disk model in which the accretion rate has changed from one epoch to the next (without considering additional continuum emission components). The fit to the composite residual has two free parameters: a normalizing constant and the average characteristic temperature *. In turn, in a standard disk the characteristic temperature is dependent on the ratio of the mass accretion rate to the square of the black hole mass. Therefore, provided enough time has elapsed for a composite disk spectrum to adjust to a new average characteristic temperature, reasonably consistent with the standard model, we conclude that most of the UV-optical variability observed in QSOs may be due to processes involving changes in disk accretion rates. This is consistent with the conclusion that a significant fraction of a QSO's UV-optical spectrum comes directly from the disk.},

abstract = {We present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between the H$\beta$ broad-line region (BLR) radius and the luminosity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surface brightness decompositions of the host galaxies of nine new AGNs imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. The surface brightness decompositions allow us to create AGN-free images of the galaxies, from which we measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measured through the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. We also incorporate 20 new reverberation-mapping measurements of the H$\beta$ time lag, which is assumed to yield the average H$\beta$ BLR radius. The final sample includes 41 AGNs covering four orders of magnitude in luminosity. The additions and updates incorporated here primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the R BLR-L relationship. The best fit to the relationship using a Bayesian analysis finds a slope of , consistent with previous work and with simple photoionization arguments. Only two AGNs appear to be outliers from the relationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubt regarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. The scatter around the relationship is found to be 0.19 ± 0.02 dex, but would be decreased to 0.13 dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. A large fraction of the remaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distances to the AGN host galaxies. Our results help support the possibility that the R BLR-L relationship could potentially be used to turn the BLRs of AGNs into standardizable candles. This would allow the cosmological expansion of the universe to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a larger range of redshifts.},

abstract = {We present measurements of dust reddening using the colors of stars with spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline. We achieve uncertainties of 54, 34, 25, and 28 mmag in the colors u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements confirm our earlier "blue tip" reddening measurements (Schlafly 2010), finding reddening coefficients different by -4\%, 2\%, 1\%, and 2\% in u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z from those found by the blue tip method, after accounting for a small 4\% normalization effect plausibly caused by the different sky footprint available for this analysis. These results prefer an R\_V=3.1 Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law to O'Donnell (1994) or Cardelli (1989) reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients from the Schlegel et al. (1998, SFD) maps of E(B-V) to extinction in 88 bandpasses for 4 values of R\_V using this reddening law. These coefficients supersede those in SFD and amount to a recalibration of SFD.},

abstract = {X-shooter is the first 2nd generation instrument of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). It is a very efficient, single-target, intermediate-resolution spectrograph that was installed at the Cassegrain focus of UT2 in 2009. The instrument covers, in a single exposure, the spectral range from 300 to 2500 nm. It is designed to maximize the sensitivity in this spectral range through dichroic splitting in three arms with optimized optics, coatings, dispersive elements and detectors. It operates at intermediate spectral resolution (R \~{} 4000-17 000, depending on wavelength and slit width) with fixed \'{e}chelle spectral format (prism cross-dispersers) in the three arms. It includes a 1.8″ × 4″ integral field unit as an alternative to the 11'' long slits. A dedicated data reduction package delivers fully calibrated two-dimensional and extracted spectra over the full wavelength range. We describe the main characteristics of the instrument and present its performance as measured during commissioning, science verification and the first months of science operations.},

abstract = {We present a composite spectrum of 60 long duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows with redshifts in the range 0.35<z<6.7 observed with low resolution optical spectra. The composite spectrum covers the wavelength range 700-6600 A in the rest frame and has a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 150 per 1 A pixel and reaches a maximum of \~{}300 in the range 2500-3500 A. Equivalent widths are measured from metal absorption lines from the Lya line to \~{}5200 A, and associated metal and hydrogen lines are identified between the Lyman break and Lya line. The average transmission within the Lyman forest is consistent with that found along quasar lines of sight. We find a temporal variation in fine structure lines when dividing the sample into bursts observed within 2 hours from their trigger and those observed later. Other lines in the predominantly neutral gas show variations too, but this is most likely a random effect caused by weighting of individual strong absorption lines and which mimics a temporal variation. Bursts characterized with high or low prompt GRB energy release produce afterglows with similar absorption line strengths, and likewise for bursts with bright or faint optical afterglows. Bursts defined as dark from their optical to X-ray spectral index have stronger absorption lines relative to the optically bright bursts. The composite spectrum has strong CaII and MgII absorption lines as commonly found in dusty galaxies, however, we find no evidence for dust or a significant molecular content based on the non-detection of diffuse interstellar bands. Compared to starburst galaxy spectra, the GRB composite has much stronger fine structure lines, while metal absorption lines are weaker.},

The data are presented in tables, spectra, and difference spectra and described in detail. Fe II is found to be the largest contributor to the emission line spectrum, with strong UV Fe II lines in all QSOs (regardless of the strength of the optical Fe II lines) and an abundance ratio suggesting a factor-of-three overabundance of Fe relative to Mg and probably H. A discrepancy between the observed Fe II strength and the predictions of dustless standard photoionization models is noted, and the addition of a high-density component to the models is suggested.},

abstract = {We present line and continuum measurements for 9818 SDSS type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with z ≤ 0.75. The data are used to study the four-dimensional space of black hole mass, normalized accretion rate (L/LEdd), metallicity, and redshift. The main results are (1) L/LEdd is smaller for larger mass black holes at all redshifts. (2) For a given black hole mass, L/LEdd z$\gamma$ or (1 + z)$\delta$, where the slope $\gamma$ increases with black hole mass. The mean slope is similar to the star formation rate slope over the same redshift interval. (3) The Fe II/H$\beta$ line ratio is significantly correlated with L/LEdd. It also shows a weaker negative dependence on redshift. Combined with the known dependence of metallicity on accretion rate, we suggest that the Fe II/H$\beta$ line ratio is a metallicity indicator. (4) Given the measured accretion rates, the growth times of most AGNs exceed the age of the universe. This suggests past episodes of faster growth for all those sources. Combined with the Fe II/H$\beta$ result, we conclude that the broad emission line metallicity goes through cycles and is not a monotonously decreasing function of redshift. (5) FWHM([O III] $\lambda$5007) is a poor proxy for $\sigma$*, especially for high L/LEdd. (6) We define a group of narrow-line type 1 AGNs (NLAGN1s) by their luminosity- (or mass-) dependent H$\beta$ line width. Such objects have L/LEdd ≥ 0.25, and they comprise 8\% of the type 1 population. Other interesting results include negative Baldwin relationships for EW(H$\beta$) and EW(Fe II) and a relative increase of the red part of the H$\beta$ line with luminosity.},

abstract = {We present the first J-band spectrum of Mrk 231, which reveals a large He I* $\lambda$10830 broad absorption line with a profile similar to that of the well-known Na I broad absorption line. Combining this spectrum with optical and UV spectra from the literature, we show that the unusual reddening noted by Veilleux et al. is explained by a reddening curve like those previously used to explain low values of total-to-selective extinction in Type Ia supernovae. The nuclear starburst may be the origin and location of the dust. Spatially resolved emission in the broad absorption line trough suggests nearly full coverage of the continuum emission region. The broad absorption lines reveal higher velocities in the He I* lines (produced in the quasar-photoionized H II region) compared with the Na I and Ca II lines (produced in the corresponding partially ionized zone). Cloudy simulations show that a density increase is required between the H II and partially ionized zones to produce ionic column densities consistent with the optical and IR absorption line measurements and limits, and that the absorber lies \~{}100 pc from the central engine. These results suggest that the He I* lines are produced in an ordinary quasar BAL wind that impacts upon, compresses, and accelerates the nuclear starburst's dusty effluent (feedback in action), and the Ca II and Na I lines are produced in this dusty accelerated gas. This unusual circumstance explains the rarity of Na I absorption lines; without the compression along our line of sight, Mrk 231 would appear as an ordinary iron low-ionization, broad absorption line quasar.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of an unusual, extremely dust-rich and metal-strong damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption system (DLA) at a redshift za = 2.4596 toward the quasar SDSS J115705.52+615521.7 with an emission-line redshift ze = 2.5125. The quasar spectrum, taken in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, shows a very red color and a number of metal absorption lines, including C II, Al II, Si II, Fe II, and Zn II, which are confirmed and further characterized by follow-up spectroscopy made with the Multiple Mirror Telescope. Its neutral hydrogen column density N H I  = 1021.8±0.2 cm-2 is among the highest values measured in quasar DLAs. The measured metal column density is N Zn II  ≈ 1013.8 cm-2, which is about 1.5 times larger than the largest value in any previously observed quasar DLAs. We derive the extinction curve of the dusty DLA using a new technique, which is an analog of the "pair method" widely used to measure extinction curves in the Milky Way (MW). The best-fit curve is an MW-like law with a significant broad feature centered around 2175 \AA in the rest frame of the absorber. The measured extinction AV ≈ 0.92 mag is unprecedentedly high in quasar DLAs. After applying an extinction correction, the i-band absolute magnitude of the quasar is as high as Mi ≈ -29.4 mag, placing it as one of the most luminous quasars ever known. The large gas-phase relative abundance of [Zn/Fe] ≈1.0 indicates that metals are heavily depleted onto dust grains in the absorber. The dust depletion level is between that of the warm and cool clouds in the MW. This discovery is suggestive of the existence of a rare yet important population of dust-rich DLAs with both high metallicities and high column densities, which may have significant impact on the measurement of the cosmic evolution of neutral gas mass density and metallicity.},

abstract = {We present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas, producing intense starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak luminosity of the quasar, and we determine this dependence using a large set of simulations of galaxy mergers varying host galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions (LFs) and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with a certain peak luminosity, n(L\_peak,z). Quasars spend extended periods of time at luminosities well below peak, and so n(L\_peak) has a maximum corresponding to the 'break' in the observed LF, falling off at both brighter and fainter luminosities. From n(L\_peak) and our simulation results, we obtain self-consistent fits to hard and soft X-ray and optical quasar LFs and predict many observables, including: column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the LF of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and the broad-line fraction as a function of luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios at z\~{}0-2, the z=0 mass function of relic BHs and total mass density of BHs, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, and unlike previous modeling attempts, we are able to reproduce them without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions. We provide a library of Monte Carlo realizations of our models for comparison with observations. (Abridged)},

abstract = {Data from complex modern astronomical instruments often consist of a large number of different science and calibration files, and their reduction requires a variety of software tools. The execution chain of the tools represents a complex workflow that needs to be tuned and supervised, often by individual researchers that are not necessarily experts for any specific instrument. The efficiency of data reduction can be improved by using automatic workflows to organise data and execute the sequence of data reduction steps. To realize such efficiency gains, we designed a system that allows intuitive representation, execution and modification of the data reduction workflow, and has facilities for inspection and interaction with the data. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has developed Reflex, an environment to automate data reduction workflows. Reflex is implemented as a package of customized components for the Kepler workflow engine. Kepler provides the graphical user interface to create an executable flowchart-like representation of the data reduction process. Key features of Reflex are a rule-based data organiser, infrastructure to re-use results, thorough book-keeping, data progeny tracking, interactive user interfaces, and a novel concept to exploit information created during data organisation for the workflow execution. Reflex includes novel concepts to increase the efficiency of astronomical data processing. While Reflex is a specific implementation of astronomical scientific workflows within the Kepler workflow engine, the overall design choices and methods can also be applied to other environments for running automated science workflows.},

We find that the synthetic magnitudes calculated from our spectra through the I\_KC band agree extremely well with the observed photometry, to better than 1\% on average. For the monochromatic fluxes, we find an internal precision better than 0.01 mag blueward of 9000 A, and increasingly larger for longer wavelengths. We present also a fine grid of averaged monochromatic fluxes (at continous steps of 16 A) for the ten secondary standards selected for our program, to be used in the flux calibration of high-dispersion spectra. Finally, we provide combined fluxes for all secondary and tertiary standards in the range 3300–10,500 A resulting form the calibration presented here with the one published in Paper I (Hamuy et al. 1992).},
