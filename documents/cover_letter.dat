We thank the referee for a very thorough and careful review of our manuscript
and for a very constructive report. The questions asked and changes suggested
has helped improve the manuscript.

We go through the refereeâ€™s comments one at a time and comment below. We have marked 
all changes in boldface in the manuscript.

=================================================================
S 2, par 1 -- explain what is meant by "stripe 82"

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
Stripe 82 is one of the regions observed as part of the SDSS. SDSS mainly
covers the north galactic pole, but when unavailable, three stripes towards the
south galactic cap is observed. The middle of these stripes is called Stripe
82. The name stripe comes from the shape of the observation coverage. We have
added a reference:
OLD:
"In stripe 82 about 50 such candidate QSOs has been studied using the New
Technology Telescope (NTT)."
NEW:
In the central southern SDSS footprint, Stripe 82 (Annis et al. 2014), about 50
such candidate QSOs has been studied using the New Technology Telescope (NTT).

=================================================================
S 3, par 1 -- Ultimately 7 QSOs were selected for the study,
 but how many could have been selected?

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
173 SDSS quasars in total fulfill the selection criteria. The full sample of
SDSS quasars fulfilling the selection criteria is used to test for systematic
differences caused by selecting a subsample in section 6.2. We have clarified
the text a bit to include the full number of objects.

OLD:
a smaller sample will suffice. We have consequently selected 7 of the brightest
SDSS QSOs at $1 < z < 2.1$ with declinations
NEW:
a smaller sample will suffice. From the 166,583 quasars presented in the SDSS
DR10 quasar catalog \citep{Paris2014}, 173 objects fulfill our selection
criteria. Of these quasars, 102 are at declinations < +15 from which we select
7 without signs of BAL activity or other strong associated absorption systems
at declinations $\lesssim +15^\circ$ that have SDSS spectra and are observable
in a single visitor run at the Very Large Telescope (VLT).

Fig. 1 -- Should the "1e-16" be on the left side label?  What
 are the units?

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
This is a mistake in the labeling of the plot. The units are flux densities:
erg s^1 cm^-2 AA^-1. The "1e-16" refers to the scale of the numbers. We
have changed both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, to include the scaling as part of the
units. This also leaves more space for the figure. Additionally an effort has
been made to reduce the file-sizes of the images.

S 4.2, par 1 -- Why use a 2-degree radius for the average
 extinction value?  That seems large compared to the
 resolution of the Schlegel et al. maps.

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
We have used the service http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/, which
queries the dust maps. This service gives cut-outs of 2x2degrees in 82x82
pixels. We have previously been using just a mean for the queried dust in the
cut-out, but following the suggestion by the referee we have updated the E(B-V)
values to use only the 4 central pixel values. The resolution of the dust-map
used is now ~3 arc min. We have updated the text to reflect the improved
resolution and updated the composite with the new extinction values. This also
slightly changes the inferred values of the slopes and the inferred synthetic
magnitudes, which we have updated throughout the text. No qualitative changes
to the conclusions are needed. Additionally an error in the estimation of the
absolute magnitudes was corrected and an erroneous scaling of the composite by
(1+z) was corrected. 

S 4.5, par 1 -- The pixel filtering process is not clear.
 Does the filter have a width and profile?  The 20% change
 is with respect to what?

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
The pixel filtering process is literally just the pixel-to-pixel variation. I
make a comparison between neighboring pixels, running from low wavelength to
high and mask the pixels which has high variation. This is to mask out the
noisy pixels from the XShooter-reduction of which it tends to have quite a few
of. Since the error image is not correspondingly off in value and no bad-pixel
flags are set. Including these noisy pixels will propagate into the composite.
We have updated the text for a more clear description.

S 4.6, par 1 -- The sampling used for the q-q plot is not clear.
 I assume that the average flux density value of 100 pixels
 covering a specified wavelength region was found for each
 of the 7 spectra.  The text doesn't seem to say this.

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
This is correctly assumed! We have updated the text to better describe the sampling used for the q-q plot.

S 4.7, par 1 -- What values of the cosmological parameters
 did you use to calculate the luminosity distance?

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
This is stated in the last paragraph of the introduction. Please see S 1, par 4

S 5, par 2 -- "a straight line adequately describes the continuum"
 Does this mean in log-log space, or equivalently, that a single
 power law is adequate?

This exactly means in log-log space and that a single power law is adequate. We
have updated the text to more clearly describe the reflect this.

S 5.1 -- Can you distinguish between dust reddening and a difference
 in spectral slope (or some combination)?  This may be outside
 of the scope of the paper.

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
It is true that there must be a distribution of slopes and that if the
intrinsic slope of the quasar continuum is different from what is assumed
using the composite, an erroneous amount of dust will be inferred. This is
outside the scope of the paper, but we have added a paragraph to address this
comment. Specifically changes in quasar slope will change only the slope,
whereas dust will change both the slope and the curvature.  Also, please see
section 6.1.

S 6.3, par 2 -- I think you mean "bluewards" instead of "redwards"
 in "composites are visible redwards of Ly-alpha".

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
Correct, thanks for pointing this out.

S 6.3, par 3 -- Do you mean "bluewards of 10000 A" ?

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
Correct, thanks.

S 6.3, par 3 -- Are there at least two continuum regions covered
 by all of the spectra?  If so, a direct comparison could be
 made at least using those regions.

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE:
The only emission-free continuum region available in most other composites is
just redwards of Lyman Alpha. A power-law fit to this short region would be too
uncertain for a meaningful comparison, since the specifics of the region 
(definition of the boundaries) would dominate the variance of the results. We 
have added some text to better clarify this.
